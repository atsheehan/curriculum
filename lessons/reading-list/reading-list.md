Books rule. Whether you prefer PDF, eReader, or the dead-tree edition, there's nothing like cracking open a book and incorporating some new processes and ideas into your workflow. Here are a few select books designed to hit you right in your cerebellum.

#### _The Well-Grounded Rubyist_ by David A. Black

_The Well-Groudnded Rubyist_ is billed as a book that is geared towards Ruby beginners _and_ advanced users of the language. Use this book to fill in the gaps in your understanding of the Ruby Programming Language.

#### _Rails 4 Way_ by Obie Fernandez

If there is one "must have" book about the Rails framework, this is it. This book explains all of the implementation details of Rails. It works better as a reference than a straight-through read. If you ever need clarification on configuration, routing, Active Record associations, validations, helpers, sessions, or security, this book covers all the intricacies of the Rails stack. It's great to have on your desk for that moment when you need to understand what's happening and how to write your code using Rails conventions.

#### _Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec_ by Aaron Sumner

_Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec_ is an excellent supplement to the Test-Driven Development workflow that we teach here at Launch. The author covers how to test all the critical parts of a Rails application: Models, Controllers, Feature specs with Capybara, as well as email, rake tasks, and file uploads. The techniques covered in this book will take your testing skills with RSpec to the next-level.

#### _Design Patterns in Ruby_ by Russ Olsen

_Design Patterns in Ruby_ takes some of the most important design patterns introduced by the [Gang of Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), and presents them in the context of the Ruby programming language. It is packed with patterns that will help you to solve the common problems we face as software developers and gives you the language to talk about them with your colleagues. The Adapter Pattern, the Listener Pattern, the Factory Pattern, and other classic design patterns are dissected and explained in the text and code examples. It also covers patterns that have evolved out of the Ruby programming language such as **Domain-Specific Language**, **Meta-programming**, and **Convention Over Configuration**.

#### _Algorithms Unlocked_ by Thomas H. Cormen

An algorithm is a step-by-step solution to a problem. _Algorithms Unlocked_ explains searching, sorting, cryptographic, and compression algorithms in a language-agnostic way so that you can apply them to any programming language. Learning to read and write algorithms in [psuedocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) will help you to translate the concepts you have learned through the Ruby programming language to other languages.
