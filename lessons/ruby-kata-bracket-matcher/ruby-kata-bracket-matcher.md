Write a method `def bracket_match?(string)` that takes a string and returns `true` or `false` based on whether or not the brackets in `string` match. For example, consider the following examples:

* "Hi! What is your name again (I forgot)?" has matching brackets.
* "Hi! What is (your name again? I forgot" has unmatching brackets.

Notes:

* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
