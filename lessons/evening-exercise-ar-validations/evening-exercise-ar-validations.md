Time to validate our Brussels Sprouts recipes in our blog.

###Learning Goals
* Ensure that data stored in records is of valid type
* Examine the effect that enforced datatypes has on our code

###Instructions
* Last night you created a Brussels Sprouts recipe blog. We are going to add some validations to it.
* Validate that the title of each recipe exists.
* Validate that the title of each recipe is unique.
* Validate that the title of each recipe contains "Brussels sprouts" in it.
* Validate that the length of a comment be a maximum of 140 characters long.
* Validate that a comment has a recipe.
* Add a field `yield` to your Recipe table. Yield is explained [here](http://chefsblade.monster.com/training/articles/211-the-ultimate-guide-to-recipe-calculation). `yield` is optional, but if supplied, it must be greater than or equal to 1. Write a validation for this.
* Load up your app in irb and comfirm that your validations work.

####Output
Update your README.md file to include your validation checks. Submit your code through `et`.
