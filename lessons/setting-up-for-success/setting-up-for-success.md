In this article, you will take specific action to optimize your career opportunities. Do not skip any of these steps.

#### Register With One of Our Recruitment Partners

* [Incendia](http://www.incendia.com/job-seekers.html)

#### Create an AngelList Profile

[Create an AngelList profile](https://angel.co/join) and populate your profile.

Be sure to fill in your:

* LinkedIn URL
* GitHub URL
* Your Mini-Resume
* Your Blog URL
* The fact that you are a "Developer" in the "I am a" section

Also, be sure to upload a professional photo.

There are great jobs listed on AngelList. [Browse and apply](https://angel.co/jobs) to positions that are of interest using the skills we have taught you in previous assignments.

#### Create a White Truffle Profile

We have partnered with White Truffle to expose you to opportunities outside of our hiring network.

[Join the network](http://www.launchacademy.com/whitetruffle) and create an anonymous profile.

#### Finalize Your Resume

Work with Corinne to finalize your resume. Be sure to have printed copies ready for Career Day and subsequent meetings with hiring managers.

#### Update LinkedIn

Ensure LinkedIn is up to date with all of your recent projects, URL's, and experience.

#### Commit to GitHub, Daily

You should be committing code to GitHub, daily. Demonstrate your continued learning and progress towards becoming a software developer!

#### Create and engage with a StackOverflow Account

[Create an account](http://stackoverflow.com/users/login) (if you haven't already) and start answering questions to the best of your ability. Read through [how to answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-answer). Spend forty minutes each day on StackOverflow. Set up watched tags for the following phrases (intentionally comma delimited for easy copy and pasting):

```no-highlight
rails, ruby, css, agile, jquery, software-engineering, ruby-on-rails, git, github, html5, javascript, ruby-on-rails
```

For best results, pick two to three questions to answer per day. Spend sufficient time researching and drafting a response to ensure your answer gets upvoted.

#### Engage on Twitter and Other Social Media

Tweet at least once a day. Share resources you found helpful, and always tweet when you create new content.

[Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/) is a great tool for queuing up posts to be distributed over time.

Optionally, you can also engage on sites like [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) though hiring managers are less likely to look there.
