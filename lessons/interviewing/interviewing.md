### Learning Objectives

* Understand how to prepare and conduct yourself during a technical interview
* Demonstrate how to follow up post interview

### Implementation Details

Interviews can be daunting and awkward. In this assignment, we'll show you how to prepare for the interview, and how to transform them into a conversational and relaxed dialog.

#### Before The Interview

**Ask about appropriate dress**. If you aren't yet aware of the dress code for an interview, it is perfectly reasonable to ask what the culture demands. A simple question like "so that I can match the vibe and culture of your company, what would you recommend I wear?" Launch Academy staff can also help with advising on this subject. Business casual is most typical.

**Pack Resumes and a Padfolio or Professional Notepad or Notebook**. Ensure you have at least 5-10 copies of your resume handy should someone need it.

**Research and Study**. Diligent preparation is necessary to effectively answer any interview question.

**Study hard**. Learn as much as you can about the job, the employer and its executives beforehand. Use this information to answer direct questions and to then segue into a discussion about your qualifications and fit.  Try to tailor your interview answers to the company's issues.  When questions come up that you don’t have 'the right' answer to, you can steer the conversation to how you can demonstrate value based on your research about the company’s needs.  You answer the question, but maybe not 100% the way they were expecting it.

**Have anecdotes ready**. Many interviewers ask questions that require candidates to provide examples of how they handled a difficult challenge or other work situation. Such questions often start with a phrase such as, "Tell me about a time when you faced..."

**Prepare questions that you want answers to**. Having your own questions is important to establish a conversational tone to the interview. It also indicates that you've thought about the role and done your own diligence. You might get answers to those questions indirectly through the course of the interview, but having a list is a good way to be prepared. These questions should be thought provoking. **Do not** ask questions that can be answered via information on the website or that were already answered during previous interactions with the company.

Here are a few suggested questions:

* What would be some tasks I would have and what specific skill are you seeking from me for this role?
* What does a typical day look like?
* Do you work in teams, pairs or separately?
* Who would I be reporting to?
* What are the various ways you monetize your products/services?
* What are your company goals for this year? This quarter?
* How are you internally structured?
* How did the company get started?

Come with a large list and ask them when it contextually makes sense.

**Get Sleep**. Ensure that you get to be early and that you leave yourself enough time in the morning to physically and mentally prepare for the event.

**Mentally Prepare**. In the lead up to a big game, professional athletes visualize success, double-check their equipment or listen to a favorite song on their headphones – all before heading into competition. The minutes before you leave your house for that big job interview might not contain the same level of intensity, but mental preparation can still mean the difference between victory (getting the job) and defeat (back to the classifieds).

Experts recommend that job hunters visualize in their minds how the interview will go. A little edginess before an interview can be helpful if it makes you alert and energized, but too much anxiety can be disastrous. Practicing deep breathing or repeating a tranquil word like "calm" are popular methods people use to get themselves ready for a tense situation. And, again, mental preparation well in advance of an interview is key.

To gain confidence, executive coaches advise you write down several of your greatest accomplishments and then list the skills you used to achieve them. If you know your skills and how you make a difference, it will be easier to talk about them in an interview setting.

The same logic applies to your weaknesses. Long before the day of the interview, candidates should think of solid answers to three questions they don’t want to be asked. Write them down if you have to and go over them several times. This will go a long way toward relieving anxiety.

**Ask a Developer**. If you have a connection or someone you'd be comfortable asking, you can email them in advance of the interview looking for perspective on the following questions:

* Anything I should know before jumping into an interview or in exploring a position at <company name>?
* Why do you love working for <company name>?
* What are you working on right now, and what makes it special to you?

#### Arrival

**Get close early**. Find a nearby coffee shop or place to hangout and arrive there 30 minutes early. This eliminates any variability like traffic or train delays.

**Appear punctual**. Don't show up to the office too early, as it could appear overeager or rude. Arrive 5-10 minutes prior to the scheduled time.

**Be courteous to everyone**! The moment that you step foot onto the company's property, you should be respectful and courteous to every individual you encounter. You never know - that person that cut you in line in the lobby or the individual that slammed the bathroom door in front of you could be the CEO! Be pleasant, calm, and collected with each interaction.

Dan once heard an interview horror story where an interview candidate was running late and someone stole his parking spot. He flipped the person off and eventually found another spot. Imagine their disappointment when the person they flipped off ended up being an executive team member interviewing him! Don't make the same mistake.

**Silence your phone and other noisemakers**. Indicate to your interviewers that nothing is more important than the conversation you're engaged in.

**Greet the hiring manager/first interviewer and make eye contact**. It's fairly customary to shake the hand of the person that receives you. Make eye contact and identify that you're a personable and approachable person who is not overly nervous.

#### Responding to Questions

Your objective through the entire interview is to achieve a conversational tone about how you fit with the company. If the conversation evolves into a very transactional nature of Q&A with short answers, things can get derailed and awkward quickly. Attempt to achieve what we call "Question Ping Pong".

Example:

```no-highlight
Interviewer: Tell us one thing you liked about the practices at Launch Academy

Interviewee: I really enjoyed pair programming. Each time I paired, I felt like we really helped each other develop our skills. Do you pair program at Acme, Inc.?

Interviewer: We don't, but we'd like to. It's definitely something the dev team has been asking about.

Interviewee: Yeah, I realize it can be tough for businesses to jump into such a dynamic, with looming deadlines and urgent priorities. What's been the major impediment to getting there?

...
```

Above, a simple question turns into a **conversation**. This is a much more pleasant experience for the interviewer as opposed to just rifling through a list of canned questions. Try to make the dialog as interactive and unique as possible. This can be achieved by answering an open ended question with more than a few words, and asking a related follow up question of the interviewer.

#### The Whiteboard Test and Coding Questions

**Practice using the same medium (e.g. paper and pencil) and time limits (e.g. 30 minutes) as the real interview.** Some companies use whiteboard coding questions, yet often candidates practice by coding alone at home on a computer with a compiler. During the actual interview, they stand at the whiteboard and forget how to initialize an array, without their trusty syntax highlighter. Or they are so nervous having another person watching them that they panic and can't think straight. In real life, if you plan to swim the English Channel, would you limit your practice to laps at the local swimming pool? No, you would go test out the ocean waves, the salt water. Do the same here.  Ask your interviewer at Career Day the format of the interview and any coding questions. If the company gives the candidates an hour alone in a room with an editor and no compiler, practice that at home. If the company does whiteboard questions with an interviewer watching you, ask a fellow Launcher or EE to be your mock interviewer.

**During the interview, don't obsess over little mistakes that happen.** Often, when even a star candidate is provided a coding question, they zero in on the most optimally performant solution, identified the boundary cases, and began writing well-designed code. Midway through the problem, they make a minor error -- getting the order of operations wrong on the first try, or having an off-by-1 error, or forgetting to declare a variable.  When the interviewer points it out, the candidate responds with horror and then becomes so nervous that it impacts their performance during the rest of the interview.  The fear is unfounded. An awesome candidate making a little error is like a concert violinist playing a challenging Brahms concerto and hitting two wrong notes. Sure, the audience could tell that he made mistakes, but they don't get confused as to whether he's actually at Twinkle-Twinkle-Little-Star level.  Even if you completely bomb one question, many interviewers ask you multiple questions and will forgive a single mishap. Even bombing an entire interview is recoverable if the other interviews go well.

Consider taking these steps:

1. Ask questions. You want to make sure you understand what you're being asked to solve. Confirm your understanding of the requirements, using your own words. This can also be an effective way to buy yourself time as you start to reason through the problem.

2. Talk out loud as you solve the problem. The interviewer wants to know how you think and problem solve. If you remain quiet, it's harder to ascertain that. This is often the hardest part of the process, so be sure to practice that with your mentor group and with fellow Launchers.

3. Openly discuss the trade offs in your algorithm decisions. Acknowledging the weak links in your approach demonstrates that you're aware where potential trouble spots may arise, and offers up why you were willing to make your trade-offs.

4. Write code. Although you can sketch out pseudo code for an outline, you need to inform interviewers that's what you're doing so they don't assume it's your final version. After writing pseudo code, you'll need to hunker down and write the actual code.

5. Test your code. Interviewers expect to see bugs, so don't be shy about fixing them. What they're looking for is how you fix the bugs. If each interviewer notices a pattern where you take a band-aid approach that's likely to introduce other problems, don't expect to be hired.

If you don't know the answer, or you can't figure it out, don't panic. Show your resourcefulness and walk the interviewer through your thought process. If you're stumped, you could say something like "At this point, I'd have to refer to the rubydocs on the inject method because I'm not sure which argument comes first. I'd then write a method that builds an ordered hash from the array." The key is to answer every question with postivity and value. This is also an opportunity for great follow up after the interview, where you can demonstrate that you've done the research to figure out how to respond to the question.

#### The Pairing Interview

One of our favorite methods for qualifying a candidate is through pairing. This is an opportunity for you to show how you effectively solve problems with software.

If your interview has this dynamic as part of it, remember what we've taught you around how to be a good collaborator.

* Think out loud
* Be courteous and polite
* Ask good questions
* Don't worry if you make an error or you need to go back and refactor a solution

#### The HR Questions

These types of questions are typical to most interviews.

* Identify a challenge and how you overcame it
* Tell me about a recent failure or difficulty working with another person
* Where do you want to be in the next 5 years?

When answering these questions, please:

* Be *honest*
* Be yourself
* Be positive
* It's as much to your benefit as it is theirs

These questions are usually asked to determine if you are a **cultural fit** for the company. It is better to determine that there is not a cultural fit early in the process than to be ungenuine and have it emerge 6 months later when you're on the job. Answer them honestly, positively, and from the true perspective of who you are.

Having prepared anecdotes and stories can really help to illustrate your points here. Remember, one word or short answers will not get you far in responses to questions like these. Tell a story and entertain the interviewer. Where you can, just like your career day speech, paint yourself as the protagonist in an epic tale of challenge and triumph.

#### The Off the Wall Questions and Brainteasers

Despite [numerous](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/06/why-brainteasers-dont-belong-in-job-interviews.html) [articles](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2013/06/google-skips-waste-of-time-brainteaser-interview-questions/) about the futility of these questions, some folks will still ask them.

These questions are less about getting the right answer and more about how you respond creatively in the face of adversity.

Don't be surprised to get questions like:

* When was the last palindrome date?
* You're trapped in a giant blender that is going to start in 3 minutes. What do you do?

Do your best to answer them creatively and gracefully, and don't be afraid to laugh or smile at the audacity of some crazy questions. They may also be looking to see if you have a sense of humor.

#### Turn Negatives Into Positives

Count on being asked about a past mistake or blemish on your career record, and don't try to dodge the issue.  If you have a vulnerability, you need to be prepared to answer the question.  There should be no lying or dodging. Just answer it and move on.  For example, if you didn't finish college, simply state why.  If it was good enough reason for you to make the decision it should be confidently delivered so as to sway the interviewer to believe they would likely have made the same decision if in your shoes.

#### The Curmudgeonly Developer

Developers do not always make great interviewers. They may ask questions that are intended to stump you, or they may make statements that are offputting or inappropriate. It's important that you maintain your composure and handle such situations professionally and courteously.

Some developers are tough to talk to. They may be very short or not extremely talkative. Ask them reciprocating questions to see if you can find a common interest.

#### Watch for Nonverbal Cues

If your interviewer appears unsure with your response, follow up with "Did that answer your question?" or "Can I elaborate on that for you?"

If your interviewer is crunched for time or appears distracted or uninterested, finish up your response.

Show your emotional intelligence by responding to nonverbal feedback during your interview. This [article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201101/using-effective-nonverbal-communication-in-job-interviews`) in Psychology Today is pretty good.

#### Closing and Understand Next Steps

Express your interest and excitement about the role. Share some of the things that stood out for you about the team, the company, and what you'd be doing there if hired. Then, ask about next steps, the process from here, and the timeframe. It's also really good to ask if there's anything you can help clarify. Asking something like "Based on what I have told you about myself, do you have any concerns at all about my ability to provide you with what you need?" is a great way to get some immediate feedback that can be useful in following up.

#### Other, General Tips

**Don't hijack the interview.** There are always the candidates who came into the interview with the mindset that they MUST tell me all about their recent project Zoolander. The interviewer begins and the candidate breaks in with, "I want to tell you about Zoolander. 10 years ago, this project started as a side feature..." and then go on for 5 minutes without taking a breath. Sometimes they decide that they must tell every interviewer about Zoolander, repeating the same description over and over during the day. Your interviewer has specific questions that they need to get through. If you hijack the interview, they may not have enough data from their own questions to be able to endorse your hiring. They may also think that you would be difficult to work with. If you really want to talk about a project, ask your interviewer, "I think project Zoolander really shows off my abilities. Can you or another interviewer fit in 10 minutes for me to explain it?" The interviewer can then refit their plan for the interview, instead of suddenly having their schedule be shanghaied. 

**When answering questions expecting a specific answer, give a high-level summary first.** Sometimes an interviewer will ask a question expecting a short answer, "How many people worked with you on project Zoolander?" The candidate then gives an audiobook, "Well, there was Jimmy -- he did the UI and I had to mentor him quite a bit on it. Then there was Mary who ran the backend servers. She worked remotely from Pennsylvania. Two years later, we got another backend person David..."  Three minutes later, the candidate is still talking, and the interviewer still doesn't know the answer of how many people worked on the project.  Give an answer first, and then expound. "There were 3 when I joined, and 12 when I left. First there was Jimmy ..."  Better yet, give the answer and *offer to expound*. "There were 3 when I joined, and 12 when I left. Would you like me to tell you what each one did?"

#### Following Up

The following day, be sure to send a follow up. You should thank the interviewer and reflect on the event. If a problem arose during the interview that you couldn't immediately answer, it would be a good idea to provide a solution or explanation in your follow up. It would also be good to expand upon some of the items discussed.

Some folks have even sent handwritten thank you notes as a personal touch. The details matter here, so do what works best for you and your personal style.

Here's a great follow up example:

```no-highlight
Hi Sam,

Thanks so much for taking the time to share more details about InnoTech and the front end developer role. I can really see myself thriving in such an amazing environment and culture!

I went back and was able to solve that recursion problem you gave me. I've pasted a gist for it @ http://gist.github.com/142341251 - I think I was stuck on getting the base case right because of an off by one error. That was definitely a challenging one! Thanks for trying to talk me through it.

Joan also mentioned she was interested in seeing more capybara examples. I've been working on another project and attached some sample spec files for her.

If there's anything I can help to clarify or expand upon, I hope that you will reach out. I'm looking forward to hearing from you, either way!

Best,
John Smith

### Rules to Follow

#### Be Personable

At the end of the day, people hire those they feel are competent and that they like. Be a good listener and engage those you interview with in a professional and positive manner.

### Why This Matters

The interview is what secures you a position! Take the time and energy to invest in this crucial step.
