Write a method `def greatest_common_factor(number1, number2)` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest number that goes evenly into both numbers with no remainder.

* If `number1` is 8 and `number2` is 4, the method would return 4.
* If `number1` is 8 and `number2` is 7, the method would return 1.
* If `number1` is 81 and `number2` is 18, the method would return 9.

Notes:

* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
