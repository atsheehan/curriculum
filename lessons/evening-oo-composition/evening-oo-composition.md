##OMG We Need Emergency Brussels Sprouts!!

We have run out of Brussels sprouts! A recent drought in the West Coast has caused a market downturn in our favorite ingredient. This is a problem.

Luckily, we have contacts in Belgium that can send us an emergency shipments of Brussels sprouts. We have requisitioned a special [Concorde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde) airplane for speed of delivery.

###Learning Goals
* Understanding the concept of Class Composition
* Implement methods to achieve desired calculations

###Instructions

Write `Airplane`, `Container` and `Ingredient` classes to help answer the following questions:

* How many total Brussels sprouts can be carried in a Concorde?
* How many containers are needed for the shipment?

Here are your assumptions:
* The Concorde has a maximum carrying capacity of 20,000 lbs.
* A single Brussels sprout weighs 20 grams.
* A single Container weighs 200 lbs and can carry a maximum weight of 300 lbs (maximum carrying weight of containers excludes the container weight).
* Do not worry about dimensions of the plane and whether or not containers would physically fit. Just assume that they will.
* Do not worry about fuel.

Non-Core:
* Add another container with a different weight and max carrying weight. How would you optimize the number of containers of type 1 and type 2?

###Output
Submit your updated code in `code.rb` and include some example cases. Adjust some of the assumptions and show us how the answers to the above questions change (i.e., what if we decide to send a 747 or a 787, instead).
