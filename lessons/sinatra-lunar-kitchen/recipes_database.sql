430	Miso Glazed Salmon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix the miso, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a small bowl. Adjust proportions to taste.\n\n\n\n2 Pour half of the mixture into a container large enough to fit the salmon fillets, then pour the rest over the top of the fish. Make sure the fish is coated with the miso sauce. Cover the container and marinate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight. \n\n\n\n3 Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil.  Brush a little vegetable oil over the foil and lay the salmon fillets on top. Make sure there is an even, thin coating of marinade on top of the fish. Place the fillets no closer than about 6 inches from the broiler element in your oven. Broil for 6-10 minutes, depending on how thick the fillets are and how hot your broiler is. Keep an eye on the salmon. The marinade has sugar in it that can easily cause the glaze to burn.  If it starts charring and the cooking isn't yet finished, place the fish on a lower rack in the oven.\n\nServe with rice and stir-fried vegetables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Fermented soybean paste. Sounds great, right? Heh. But that’s essentially what Japanese miso is, a savory, salty paste usually made with fermented soybeans or rice and barley. Rich in protein and nutrients, and utterly delicious, a little tub of miso is quite a useful ingredient to have on hand. Stir it with a little yogurt and rice vinegar for a quick and lovely salad dressing, or mix it with sake and toss it with stir-fried vegetables.\nThis recipe of salmon fillets with a miso glaze couldn’t be easier. The strong flavor of the salmon holds up beautifully with the sweet and salty miso glaze. To make, you just mix miso, some sake and soy sauce into a marinade, coat the fillets, and let the salmon marinate while working on the rest of the meal. The fish cooks under the broiler in 10 minutes or less. Marinate the fish longer, even overnight, for more infused miso flavor. You can also dress up simple cod with this method.\n
431	Green Tomato Chutney	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Sterilize the jars and lids. Place a steamer rack in a large (16 quart) pot, and place the jars on the rack. Fill the jars and the pot with water up to the rim of the jars. If you don't have a rack you can place a clean dish towel at the base of the pot. You want to prevent the glass jars from touching the bottom of the pot which can get quite hot and cause the glass to crack.  Put the burner on high and heat until a rolling boil.  Boil for 10 minutes.  To sterilize the lids, place them in a bowl and pour boiling water over them.\n\n\n\n2 Place all of the ingredients in a medium sized (about 4 qt) thick-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 45 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasonings.\n\n3 Remove the jars from the pot of hot water (reserving the water if you plan to can for shelf storage.). Scoop the green tomato chutney into the jars, filling them to 1/4 of an inch from the rim.  Wipe the rims with a clean wet paper towel.  Place sterilized lids on the jars. Secure with canning rings.\n\n\n\n4 Place the filled jars back in the pot of hot water. Make sure the jars are covered with an inch of water.  Bring to a boil and process for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes if you are at altitudes between 1000 and 6000 feet. Remove the jars from the pot and place on a dish towel spread out on your counter. Allow the jars to cool completely.  The jar lids should make a popping sound as they seal.  If a lid doesn't seal for some reason, store the jar in the refrigerator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The tomato season is winding down around here as the days grow shorter. Our tomato plants are loaded with green, unripe tomatoes. Some may still get enough sunlight and warmth to turn red, but I’m thinking most will not. If you have garden tomatoes, I would love to hear what you do with the end-of-season green ones. My mother picks them and lets them ripen indoors. I like making fried green tomatoes, and I may yet try to make a mock apple pie made with green tomatoes. Other ideas? \nThis chutney is one way to make excellent use of them. We love chutney with baked chicken or pork chops. The chutney would work as a relish for hot dogs, a side for crab cakes, or topping a little cream cheese on a cracker for an appetizer.\n \n\n
438	Pickled Okra	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare for canning by sterilizing jars and lids. Put a steamer rack at the bottom of a large (16 quart) pot, and place the jars on the rack.  Fill the pot with water to the rim of the jars.  (Note if you don't have a level steamer rack you can put a clean dish towel at the bottom of the pot, you just don't want the jars touching the bottom of the pot or they may break from the heat.) Bring to a rolling boil and boil for 10 minutes.  To sterilize the lids, place lids in a large bowl and pour boiling water over them.\n\n\n\n2 Place vinegar, water, salt, and sugar in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil to dissolve the salt and sugar, reduce heat and keep warm.\n\n\n\n3 While the water is heating in step one, prepare the okra and the spices. Rinse the okra and trim the stem ends to 1/4-inch. \n\n4 Place all pickling spices in a small bowl and stir to combine.\n\n\n\n5 Lay out a clean towel on your counter. Use canning tongs to remove the jars from the boiling water, emptying the water from the jars.  Place the hot, sterilized jars on the towel on your counter. Placing the hot jars on a towel will help prevent them from getting shocked by a cold counter surface and potentially cracking. Place a lemon slice at the bottom of each jar.  Add a tablespoon of the mixed pickling spices to each jar.  Place a peeled garlic clove on top of the spices and lemon.\n\n6 Pack the okra in the jars, alternating stem-side-up and stem-side-down to allow you to pack the okra well into the jars. The top of the okra should come between an inch to 1/2 an inch from the rim of the jar.\n\n\n\n7 Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the jars, up to 1/4-inch from the rim of the jars. Run a thin knife between the okra and the jars to dislodge any obvious air bubbles.  Okra is filled with air, so while you run the knife between the okra and the jars, air bubbles will be released from within the okra as well.  If the top level of the pickling liquid lowers while you do this, just top off with more of the pickling liquid.  If for any reason you don't have enough pickling liquid for all the jars, just add equal amounts of cider vinegar and water.  No need to heat first, the liquid will get boiled in the hot water bath.\n\n8 Wipe the rims with a clean damp towel.  Place sterilized lids on jars. Screw on the the lids, firmly, but not too tight.\n\n\n\n9 Place packed jars back in the pot with water you used to sterilize the jars.  The water should still be hot.  Because you are putting back in full jars, rather than empty jars, some water will be displaced. Allow for 1 to 2 inches of water to cover the jars. Beyond that you may want to remove excess water. Bring to a boil and process for 15 minutes.  Remove to towel lined counter or to a rack (you want to avoid putting a hot jar on a cold surface, or else the jar might crack.)\n\n10 As the jars cool, you should hear a popping sound as the vacuum created by the cooling air in the jars pulls the lid down and seals the jars. A properly sealed jar can last in a cool closet out of direct sun for about a year. If any jars do not seal, store them chilled in the refrigerator.  Opened jars should last one to two months in the refrigerator.\n\nLet sit 24 hours before eating.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A good pickle is all about texture. It should have a satisfying crunch as you bite into it. It should be firm and crisp. It should make your eyes light up with delight as you eat it. Which brings me to okra, the poster child of vegetables with texture issues. “Eww, it’s slimy!” Yes. Yes, okra often suffers from slipperiness. But it all depends on how you prepare it. Cooked fresh into a pickle, like this, it’s not slimy. It’s crunchy. I am convinced that okra makes the best pickles ever. The inside of an okra pod is somewhat hollow, with tender seeds, but a lot of air. These air pockets fill up with the pickling juice when you pickle the okra, and it’s a texture wonderland when you bite into them. That and okra just tastes good.\n \n\nI planted okra in the garden for the first time this year, so I now have my own steady supply. I have not found any decent looking okra at the stores, but the farmers market this time of year has plenty of beautiful fresh okra. Look for unblemished pods, and if you are using pint sized jars, no more than 4 inches long. \nAs for making the pickles, it couldn’t be easier. You actually pack the fresh okra into the jars with the pickling spices. Pour in pickling liquid, put lids on, and put the jars in a water bath for 15 minutes. If you are canning for shelf storage you’ll want to take the extra precautions of sterilizing the jars up front, and sterilizing the lids. But you can skip that if you just want to store them in the fridge and eat them up quickly.\n
432	Zucchini Bread with Pineapple	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).  Prepare 2 buttered 5 by 9 inch loaf pans. \n\n\n\n2 In a medium sized bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. \n\n\n\n3  In a mixer, beat eggs on medium speed for one minute.  Add the sugar and beat for one more minute.  Add the oil and vanilla; continue beating mixture until thick and foamy.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and with a spoon, stir in the zucchini and pineapple.\n\n\n\n4 A third at a time, add dry ingredients into wet and gently stir (by hand) after each addition.  Add the walnuts and raisins, blend gently.\n\n\n\n5 Divide the batter equally between the two loaf pans.  Bake for 55 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in to the center comes out clean.  Cool in pans for 10 minutes.  Turn out onto wire racks to cool thoroughly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated, from the recipe archive, with the last remaining zucchini of the season.\nEvery summer we are blessed with more zucchini than we know what to do with. Even if we don’t happen to be growing it, at least one neighbor does and we usually find ourselves with quite a few extra large zucchini batons. This zucchini bread recipe is one of my favorites from my childhood. The original came from a 1974 Sunset magazine and has the oddly delicious addition of crushed pineapple in the batter. It’s a wonderfully moist and sweet quick bread. The original recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar for 2 loaves. I’ve cut it as far back as 1 1/2 cups of sugar, which is just lightly sweet. But I think I prefer it best with a little more, 1 3/4 cups of sugar.\n
433	Mexican Green Rice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place the parsley, cilantro, poblanos, onion, garlic, and 1/2 cup of the chicken stock in a food processor. Pulse until smooth.\n\n2 Heat the oil in a thick-bottomed pot on high heat. Add the rice and stir to coat all of the grains with oil. Spread out in an even layer. Let the rice lightly brown. When it starts to brown, stir it and spread it out in an even layer again so that more of the rice browns.\n\n3 When much of the rice has lightly browned, scrape out the parsley purée from the food processor into the rice. Stir to evenly mix the purée with the rice. Let cook for a minute or two. Then add the rest of the chicken stock to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer and cover the pot. Let cook on a very low simmer for 15 minutes, or as long as your package of rice indicates is the right cooking time for your rice.\n\n4 After the cooking time indicated on your rice package, remove the pot from heat. Uncover the pot and place a clean terry towel or dish towel over the pot, then recover. The towel will help absorb excess liquid as the rice continues to cook in its own steam. (If you don't have a clean towel, you can skip this step, just cover normally.) Let sit for 20 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Can’t. Stop. Eating. This. Rice. Have you ever had green rice? It’s basically a simple rice pilaf in which you brown the rice first by frying it with a little oil. Then you mix in a purée of chiles and herbs, add stock, cover and cook. This green rice recipe easily feeds six, but somehow I’ve been eating through each batch all on my own. I just sneak into the fridge, pull out a small bowlful, zap it, and have my green rice morning-afternoon-late-night-whenever snack.\n\nThe following recipe is loosely based on a somewhat more involved recipe for arroz verde by Diana Kennedy. A classic Mexican side, the green comes from poblano chiles, parsley, and cilantro. I’ve also seen versions with spinach and Anaheim green chiles or jalapeños. It’s a perfect side for Mexican dishes, or alongside steak and beans.\nI love the idea of incorporating greens and herbs into a rice pilaf this way, and am wondering about similar recipes from other cuisines. If you have suggestions, please let us know in the comments!\n
434	Cactus and Corn Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1  Preheat oven to 425°F. Working with a large sharp knife with a fairly straight edge, scrape off any remaining prickles or nubs on the cactus paddles. Cut the paddles crosswise into 1-inch thick strips.  Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil. Place cactus, green tomatoes, white onion and jalapeños on the baking sheet in preheated oven for 12 minutes. The cactus should still be slightly crisp when pierced with a fork.\n\n\n\n2 Heat a cast iron or stick-free skillet with 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat on the stove top. When the pan is heated, add frozen corn and spread out in an even layer. Do not stir the corn. Allow it to roast in the hot pan for about 2 to 3 minutes. The corn should become browned and roasted. You can check by gently flipping a few pieces with the corner of a spatula. When corn is browned, stir and roast for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Place corn in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n\n\n3 Place the oven roasted vegetables in a food processor with the cilantro, garlic, lime juice, tequila, oregano and salt. Puree until nearly smooth, about 30 seconds. (Be careful when you remove the lid on the food processor—the heat released from the peppers will zoom up your nose and down your throat, so don’t stand directly over the open food processor.) \n\n4 Pour the salsa into a serving dish. Stir the roasted corn into the finished salsa. Allow to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Serve with tortilla chips. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Amber Stott, founder of California Food Literacy Center and the blogger behind Awake at the Whisk, as she shares this truly delightful salsa made with nopales cactus paddles. We made it together the other day, so good! ~Elise\nI’m a regular at my local farmers market. Farmers near Sacramento, California grow an impressive variety of food and every visit yields something new and tempting. A few years ago, I found a new favorite. Tucked away in a quiet corner behind mile high piles of pearly grapes and fat figs sat a man working quickly with a knife, sliding his blade across apple green paddles—cactus! (Also known as nopales, the young pads of the prickly pear cactus.) The farmer sent me on my way with several crisp paddles and some cooking suggestions. I’ve been addicted to nopales ever since.\n\n \nCactus farmer at farmers market, photo by Amber Stott\nCactus has a crisp texture and tangy vegetal taste. Some folks compare it to green beans, but I disagree. It’s got a wonderful bright, citrusy note all its own. It’s also a slimy food, but don’t worry. It never feels sticky when you bite it. \n\nWhen pairing cactus with green tomatoes, which also have a tart acidic flavor, you get an impressive salsa. This easy recipe combines several Southwestern flavors: chili peppers, cilantro, white onion, roasted corn, and even a splash of tequila (optional). The salsa is best when left to rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes to 1 hour after its made, and then eaten fresh. It will keep in the fridge for about a week. \n\n
435	Short-Rib Beef Stew with Ale	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place bacon strips in a large (5 to 6 quart), thick-bottomed Dutch oven.  Set the heat to medium high and cook the bacon until much of the fat has been rendered.  Remove bacon to a paper-towel lined plate.  Pour off all but 1 Tbsp of the bacon fat from pot. (Do not pour down the drain or you will clog your drain when the fat hardens as it cools.)\n\n2 Preheat oven to 300°F. While the bacon is cooking, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, hot paprika, smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper.  Dredge the short ribs in the flour mixture.\n\n\n\n3  Add the short ribs to the pot with the bacon fat, taking care to not crowd the pot (work in batches if necessary). Brown on all sides, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. If you want to get good browning, do not stir the short ribs unless to turn.  While the short ribs are browning, chop the bacon and set aside.\n\n\n\n4 Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the short ribs from the pot to a bowl.  Add the chopped onions to the pot. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Cook until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute. Add the ale and, using a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add tomatoes and their juices and reserved bacon. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil. Return short ribs to pot, cover, put in the preheated oven, and cook for two hours. (Alternatively, you can do the cooking on the stovetop, just lower the heat to the lowest setting and cover.)\n\n5 Peel potatoes, turnips (optional), and carrots, and cut into 1-in. pieces. Add to short ribs, cover, and cook until the vegetables are tender and meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 30-45 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste. \n\n6 Spoon off excess fat (it helps if you have a fat separator).  If you want, remove the bones before serving and cut any big pieces of meat into smaller chunks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated. From the recipe archive. First posted 2007.\nThe debate didn’t last long. “You could have used boneless beef short-ribs. You’re paying for the bones when you buy them bone-in,” my mother remarked in while we were all enjoying this wonderful stew. “It’s better with the bones,” my father and I replied, practically in unison. “Better flavor,” dad added. “And then there’s all that goodness from the marrow,” said I. Mom, not willing to give in so easily, said, “these bones are too small, I can’t see any marrow.” At this point, dad and I put our forks down and focused our gaze upon her. “Mom, just because you can’t see a hole in the bones, doesn’t mean there’s no marrow.” “But they couldn’t have cooked long enough for anything to come out.” “They cooked for two and a half hours.” “Okay. Nevermind.”\n \nAnd so it goes. Lest you think that my dad and I unfairly give my mom a hard time, tonight both of them pounced on me for not knowing who Falstaff was. “Shakespeare, Henry IV!,” said they, rolling their eyes the way they do when they realize how little I, the daughter of two teachers, really know. By the way, my mother is right more often than not, though in this case I’ll stand by our assertion that this stew tastes better, and is better for you, when cooked with the short ribs bone-in. This recipe is adapted from one in a old Sunset Magazine. We used a malty brown ale in place of the beer the original recipe calls for, and added carrots and turnips. We love turnips in stews, though they have their own unique, somewhat bitter flavor; you can easily leave them out.\n\n
436	Roasted Tomato Soup with Chipotle	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat the bottom of a rimmed baking pan or baking sheet with olive oil. Arrange the tomatoes and red pepper cut side down on the sheet. Place the garlic cloves and onion on the baking sheet. Paint olive oil over the vegetables. Sprinkle salt over the tomatoes, peppers, garlic, and onions, and bake in the oven 45 minutes, or until the skins of the tomatoes and peppers start to blacken.\n\n2 Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Pick the tomato and red pepper skins off the tomatoes and peppers and discard. Peel the skins off the garlic and discard. Reserve the baking sheet. Put the roasted tomatoes, onions, peeled garlic, roasted peppers, and chipotle into a food processor or blender. Add any of the  tomato liquid that may be left in the baking pan. Scrape up any browned bits on the pan (not blackened bits) and add those to the food processor bowl as well.  Pulse until you have a rough purée, about 60 seconds.\n\n3 Pour the purée into a medium pot. Add 2 cups of stock. Heat the soup to a simmer.  Add salt to taste.\n\nGarnish with a dollop of sour cream that has been lightly thinned with water, and freshly sliced basil or chopped cilantro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There was a time this summer that if you walked into my parent’s kitchen, most of the island counter space was covered with tomatoes from their garden. Actually I should say “our” garden, as I prep, plant, weed, prune the four sunny garden beds at my parent’s house. Mom harvests, and everyone shares. Which is a good thing, because when you are overloaded with produce you want people to share it with! Things are definitely slowing down in both mom and dad’s garden and mine. Here at the tail end of summer, we both have more green tomatoes than red, but there were still more than enough ripe tomatoes to make this roasted tomato soup.\n \nI grew up on canned tomato soup from Campbells. Personally I never liked it, but my dad loves the stuff. Roasted tomato soup made from scratch however, is a whole different beast. There’s so much more flavor, and it’s so easy to make! You just halve the tomatoes, roast them in a hot oven with some onions, peppers, and garlic for 45 minutes, and purée them with some stock. With this recipe we’ve added a smoky, spicy touch with chipotle chiles.\nIn our recipe we recommend topping with some thinned sour cream and either sliced fresh basil or chopped cilantro. Here’s my opinion on the greens. One would expect that a dish made with tomato and chipotle would lend itself to cilantro. And it does. But basil? That was a surprise. This soup simply sparkles with fresh basil.\n
437	Cheddar and Jalapeño Biscuits	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, polenta, salt, sugar, cayenne, and baking powder. Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the grated cheddar cheese and the diced jalapeños.\n\n2 Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.  Pour the cream into the center of the well and your (clean) hands to gently bring together the ingredients. If you need to add a bit more cream then do so a tiny trickle at a time. You just want everything to get wet enough so that the dough will be sticky and clumpy. \n\n3 Turn the dough out onto a surface lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough just a few times - maybe only three or four pushes. You just want it to come together. (Over-kneading will result in firmer, denser biscuits.) \n\n\n\n4 Form the dough into a disc about 3/4-inch to an inch thick.  Use a biscuit cutter (or a small juice glass) to cut round biscuit shapes out of the disk. Combine the leftover dough and keep forming small round biscuit shapes until the dough is used up.\n\n5 Place on a Silpat-lined or parchment lined baking sheet, with at least an inch or two between the biscuits.  Brush the tops of the biscuits with a little more cream.  Top the biscuits with a sprinkle of the remaining cheese.\n\n6 Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 11-12 minutes or until golden and the cheese is nicely melted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Garrett was over the other day, and made for me these fabulous cheddar jalapeño biscuits. I’ve since made them several times and each time they disappear within minutes. They are surprisingly light in texture and crumb, given the amount of cheese and cream. The secret ingredient? A quarter cup of cornmeal or polenta added to the flour. Just that amount lends a slight crunch to the biscuit, without making it gritty. The cornmeal of course works beautifully with the jalapeños and cheddar cheese. Garrett tops the biscuits with extra grated cheddar, giving them an even more cheesy edge. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, an afternoon snack, or served alongside a hot bowl of chili.\n
550	Roasted Fennel	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n\n2 Rub just enough olive oil over the fennel to coat. Sprinkle on some balsamic vinegar, also to coat. Line baking dish with Silpat or aluminum foil. Lay out the pieces of fennel and roast for 30-40 minutes, or until the fennel is cooked through and beginning to caramelize.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Normally fennel tastes like a cross between celery, cabbage, and licorice. Roasting, however, brings out an entirely new flavor – as if pine nuts decided to join the party.\n
439	Cod Sautéed in Olive Oil with Fresh Tomatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Remove any pin bones from the fillets and pat them dry. Salt the fish fillets well and set out on a cutting board. Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and set it over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the fish fillets, which should sizzle gently. Cook undisturbed for 90 seconds.\n\n2 When you see the bottom of the fish fillets turn opaque, tilt the pan and, using a large spoon, baste the tops of the fish with the hot oil. Do this constantly until the top of the fillets begin to flake, about 3 minutes. \n\n3 Add the tomato chunks, the Italian seasoning and the splash of Tabasco. Swirl around in the pan to combine and let this cook for 90 seconds. Turn off the heat.\n\n4 Put a fish fillet on everyone's plate. Swirl the tomatoes in the pan and add black pepper to taste; this swirling should emulsify the sauce. Spoon out some tomatoes and sauce for everyone and serve at once. \n\nServe with crusty bread and a dry rose wine. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Hank as he shares one of his favorite ways of preparing fish with fresh garden tomatoes. ~Elise\nTomatoes and fish are a natural pairing. Their sweetness and acidity livens up lean, white fish such as cod, walleye or sole, and it cuts some of the fattiness of oilier fish such as bluefish and mackerel. \nThis is a deceptively easy dish that requires a little attention while you are cooking it. You are cooking the fish very gently in the pan, then making what is essentially a warm vinaigrette with the tomatoes and olive oil.\n \nYou might notice that this recipe requires a quarter cup of olive oil. That might seem like a lot, but the oil forms the base of the sauce for the fish. You also need it to baste the fish fillets as they cook. With this method, you never flip the fish. You cook the other side of the fillet by basting it with hot oil. The result is a more delicate flavor that goes a long way toward preventing your fish from falling apart. \n\n
440	Banana Sheet Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) . In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.\n\n2 Beat together in a mixer the butter and sugars. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Mix in the vanilla and mashed bananas.\n\n3 Mix in half of the flour mixture, then the sour cream, then the other half of the flour mixture.\n\n4 Spread batter evenly in a greased 10x15 baking pan.  Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20 minutes, or until nicely browned and the surface bounces back when you press it with your finger.  Cool completely before frosting.\n\n5 To make the frosting, mix all of the ingredients together with an electric mixer. If too stiff to spread, add a teaspoon or two of water.  Spread the frosting evenly over the cake and slice to serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Don’t you love sheet cakes? They’re so easy to make and are perfect for large gatherings. Take this banana sheet cake. Like our banana bread it has wonderful banana flavor, but with a little more sweetness, and a tangy cream cheese frosting. One batch easily makes 30 servings, convenient for pot lucks and tailgates. This recipe comes from my friend Kelsey Fischer and her mom Janeen and is a family favorite of theirs. I’ve made a few slight adjustments, added some lemon juice to the frosting to give it more tang, and added a some vanilla to the cake batter. My dad gives it a strong two thumbs up and declares it “a keeper”. Enjoy!\n \n\n
441	Hot Dogs with Pineapple Bacon Relish	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place the strips of bacon in a skillet on medium heat. Slowly cook the bacon, turning the strips over occasionally until much of the fat is rendered and the bacon is lightly browned.  Remove the bacon strips to a paper towel lined plate.\n\n2 Pour off all but a teaspoon of the bacon fat (do this into a jar, do not pour down the drain or you will clog your pipes). Increase the heat to medium high and add the chopped onion.  Cook, stirring occasionally until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.  While the onions are cooking, finely chop the cooled bacon strips.\n\n3 In a large bowl stir to combine the bacon, onion, pineapple, and sweet pickles.  Mix in a tablespoon of sweet pickle juice. You can make ahead at this point, chill until ready to serve with the hot dogs.\n\n4 Heat the hot dogs your favorite way.  The hot dogs are already cooked when you buy them, so all you really need to do is heat them through. Over a grill, grill for about 5 minutes on a medium flame, until lightly browned, and toast the buns for a minute if you wish.  Or, put the dogs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes.  Or, pierce the hot dogs all over with a fork and put on a plate in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds per hot dog.\n\n5 Place a hot dog in a bun and top with a couple spoonfuls of relish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	You know you’ve made something good when it disappears faster than the backside of Usain Bolt. No need to beg your loved ones to take seconds on these hot dogs. You’ll be lucky if there are any left for you! Chop up some fresh pineapple, and mix it in with chopped bacon, onions, and sweet pickles. Pile the relish over a sizzling hot dog and enjoy. Watch out, it’s messy, but I think that’s just how it goes with hot dogs and relish. Slather on some mustard too. You may as well go full-on mess while you’re at it.\n
442	Stir Fried Japanese Eggplant with Ginger and Miso	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Stir the miso and the sake together in a small bowl, set aside.\n\n\n\n2 Slice the eggplants in half lengthwise.  Then slice them on a diagonal, crosswise, in a little less than 1/2-inch thick slices.\n\n\n\n3 Heat the chilies in the oil in a wok or large skillet on medium heat.  Once the chilies start to sizzle, and you can smell the aroma of the chilies, add the ginger and eggplant slices, and toss to coat with the oil.  Stir gently for several minutes until the eggplant pieces are shiny and soft.\n\n\n\n4 Add the miso-sake mixture to the eggplant pieces and gently stir to coat.  Remove from heat. Stir in the chopped shiso, Thai basil, or mint leaves, and serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Eggplant has always been a rather challenging vegetable for me. Usually I get these big whoppers that stare at me for a week before I finally roast them and make baba ganoush. Eggplant isn’t like green beans or broccoli that you can just steam and top with butter. You really need to do something with it. Fortunately, Japanese eggplant is, in my opinion, a lot easier to work with than globe eggplant. These asian eggplants are long and narrow, are much more delicate on the inside and have more tender skin. They’re lovely. This recipe for Japanese eggplant stir-fried with ginger in a miso sake sauce comes from my friend Nancy Hachisu’s stunning new cookbook, Japanese Farm Food (great book!), and according to Nancy, is her husband Tadaki’s “soul food”. \n \n\nThis year I’m growing Japanese eggplant in my garden, and have been using this recipe every time a few more eggplants get long and ripe enough to pick. So good! And so easy to make. The few ingredients are easy enough to come by, especially if you have access to an Asian market or Whole Foods. Here in Northern California you can find Japanese eggplant, miso, and sake at Safeways and Raley’s. Nancy uses shiso, a Japanese mint-like herb in this dish, which can sometimes be a challenge to find. I’m growing Thai basil which worked great as a substitute, you can also sub regular fresh mint.\n
469	Creamed Turnips	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Peel and cut the turnips into large chunks.  In a large saucepan of boiling water, add the tablespoon of salt, the peppercorns, cloves and bay leaves. You may want to tie the spices into a sachet or cheesecloth bag — this makes it easier to remove them later. Boil turnips until tender, 15 to 20 minutes, then drain and remove the spices. \n\n2 Return the turnips to the pot they boiled in and add the cream. Turn the burner to medium-low. Bring this to a gentle simmer and mash the turnips with a potato masher. Add the white pepper, the teaspoon of salt and freshly grated nutmeg to taste and serve at once. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	People either love turnips or they hate them. And if they love them, it was probably an acquired taste. I can still remember making a face when thinking I was biting into a yummy potato in one of my mother’s stews I had speared a turnip instead. Yet this dish is another proof point that almost all things taste better with butter and cream.\n
443	Quinoa Salad with Black Beans, Corn, and Tomatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put the rinsed quinoa, salt and water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Cover and simmer gently until the quinoa absorbs all the water, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Place into a large bowl and fluff up with a fork to help it cool more quickly.\n2 While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the rest of the salad. Soak the red onions in the lime juice and set aside. Soaking the onions in lime juice (or lemon juice or water) helps take the edge off of them. Mix the prepped black beans, corn kernels, tomatoes, cheese, jalapenos, cilantro, and oil into a large bowl.\n3 When the quinoa has cooled, mix it into the bean mixture. Add the red onion and the lime juice and add salt, more oil or lime juice to taste. Serve at room temperature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Quinoa is quickly becoming one of my favorite foods. How about you? Grain-like, but not really a grain, quinoa has a wonderfully nutty flavor. It’s also happily very good for you, being high in protein, fiber, magnesium, calcium, and iron. Quinoa goes well with Southwestern flavors and especially well with cheese, in particular farmers cheese, a soft, mild cheese like queso fresco or fresh mozzarella.\n\nThis quinoa salad is a toss together of black beans, fresh garden tomatoes, corn, farmers cheese, jalapeños, red onions, cilantro, and lime. Yum! It will last for days chilled which makes it a great make-ahead salad for picnics and gatherings. Enjoy.\n
444	Roasted Broccoli	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a large bowl toss the broccoli florets and minced garlic with olive oil and lemon juice until lightly coated.  Sprinkle salt over the broccoli and toss to coat.  \n\n\n\n2 Arrange the broccoli florets in a single layer on a greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Roast for 16-20 minutes, until cooked through and nicely browned.\n\n3 Put the roasted broccoli back in the bowl and toss with lots of freshly ground black pepper and the grated parmesan cheese. \n\nServe immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Kids don’t usually beg for broccoli, at least not the kids I know. So I was quite pleasantly surprised when my goddaughter Piper and her sisters Alden and Reilly not only raved about roasted broccoli, but insisted on making a batch for me during a recent visit. We sort of threw it together and the oven wasn’t working very well, so that particular incarnation of roasted broccoli wasn’t a raging success, but it was eaten with great enthusiasm nonetheless.\nNow home with a more reliable oven, I’ve recreated what I think the girls were trying to achieve. And if this were how broccoli was always served, I would beg for it too. Tender florets, tossed with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt, roasted at high heat until nicely browned around the edges and stems (with some crispy bits), and then sprinkled generously with freshly grated Parmesan cheese—yes, this is broccoli that anyone could love.\n
445	Squid Ink Pasta with Pumpkin, Sage and Browned Butter	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Slice off the top quarter of each pumpkin and scoop out the insides. (Save the seeds to make toasted pumpkin seeds.) Using a strong metal spoon or a small sharp knife, scrape all the fibrous insides out of the pumpkins.  Sprinkle the insides of the pumpkins with salt and sugar. Set the pumpkins on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, or until a fork easily pierces the flesh and the edges are lightly browned.\n\n2 Prepare the pasta water while the pumpkins are cooking. Bring a large pot of well salted water (it should taste like the sea) to a boil. When the pumpkins have about 10 minutes to go before they're done, add the pasta to the boiling water. When the pumpkins are cooked remove from the oven to a serving dish or plates.\n\n3 While the pasta is cooking, prepare the browned butter sauce. Heat the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves and cook until browned bits begin to form in the butter and there is a lovely nutty aroma. Remove any whole sage leaves you are using for garnish. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the browned butter into a large serving bowl (this will stop the butter from cooking further). Browned butter can easily turn to blackened butter, which is not the flavor you want for this recipe.\n\n4 When the pasta is ready (al dente, slightly firm, but cooked through), use tongs to remove the pasta from the pot to the large bowl with the browned butter.  Allow some of the water from the pasta to drip into the bowl, it will help with the sauce. Toss the pasta with the browned butter.  Splash a little cider vinegar over it.  Taste for salt, it will likely need a bit more, especially if you've used unsalted butter. Add more if needed. Serve the pasta in the baked pumpkin shells. Garnish with reserved whole sage leaves that you had cooked with the sliced sage in the butter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Okay, I know. This is one of those weird ones. But it is Halloween, and I was looking for something black and orange (go SF Giants!) to make, and I saw a package of squid ink pasta at The Pasta Shop in Berkeley, and I just had to have it. Have you ever had squid ink pasta? It’s pasta that has been flavored (and naturally colored) with jet black squid ink. Which now that I think about it, doesn’t sound particularly appetizing, unless of course you’ve tried it. In which case you will go to great lengths to obtain and consume it. Squid ink pasta is absolutely delicious. Like, don’t-bother-me, leave-me-alone-while-I-savor-this, wow-this-is-good, delicious. As for the specific taste? The pasta itself is only lightly flavored with the squid ink, so the pasta tastes like pasta, just really good. (How’s that for an explanation?)\n \nThis recipe is sort of like a deconstructed classic pumpkin ravioli in sage browned butter sauce, except that the pumpkin is on the outside, and the pasta with the sage browned butter sauce is on the inside. To eat it, you can take a small scoop of pumpkin from the inside of the pumpkin and swirl it with a little pasta. \nDo you like squid ink pasta? What’s your favorite preparation? Please let us know in the comments. I have more that I haven’t yet cooked, so I’m looking for ideas, thanks!\n\n
446	Roasted Pumpkin Seeds	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Cut open the pumpkin by cutting a circle around the stem end with a sharp knife (knife blade angled in), and pulling off the top. Use a strong metal spoon to scrape the insides of the pumpkin and scoop out the seeds and strings. Place the mass of pumpkin seeds in a colander and run under water to rinse and separate the seeds from everything else.\n\n2 Measure the pumpkin seeds in a cup measure. Place the seeds in a medium saucepan. Add 2 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of salt to the pan for every half cup of pumpkin seeds. Add more salt if you would like your seeds to be saltier. Bring the salted water and pumpkin seeds to a boil. Let simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain.\n\n3 Preheat the oven to 400°F. Coat the bottom of a roasting pan or thick baking sheet with olive oil, about a tablespoon. Spread the seeds out over the roasting pan in a single layer, and toss them a bit to coat them with the oil on the pan. Bake on the top rack until the seeds begin to brown, 5-20 minutes, depending on the size of the seeds. Small pumpkin seeds may toast in around 5 minutes or so, large pumpkin seeds may take up to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on the pumpkin seeds so they don't get over toasted. When lightly browned, remove the pan from the oven and let cool on a rack. Let the pumpkin seeds cool all the way down before eating.\nEither crack to remove the inner seed (a lot of work and in my opinion, unnecessary) or eat whole.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	From the recipe archive, don’t throw out your pumpkin seeds! ~Elise\nFall has arrived and with it, the pumpkin season. There are always plenty of pumpkins to carve up around Halloween time and a great way to make use of the pumpkin seeds is eat them, salted and toasted. Our preference is with the shells on – if they are toasted properly they are wonderfully crunchy and easy to eat. It helps if you are going to eat them with the shells on that you use seeds from sugar pumpkins, somewhat smaller than the mega-sized carving pumpkins (not really pumpkins but large squash). The trick? Boil the seeds in salted water first, and then toast them in the oven.\n
447	Celery Stir Fry	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHeat the oils and chiles in a wok or frying pan over high heat for 90 seconds, or until the chiles become fragrant and the seeds sizzle. Add the celery and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce and stir-fry one more minute. Serve hot or at room temperature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Celery. We take it for granted, don’t we? It adds crunch to potato salads, and flavor to chicken stock and turkey stuffing; it’s ever the bridesmaid, never the bride. That’s why I was intrigued when I saw a recipe for celery stir-fry in my friend Nancy Hachisu’s Japanese Farm Food cookbook, a simple celery stir-fry with chili infused oil and soy sauce. Such a simple preparation, and so so good. Try it!\n
448	Southern Cornbread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put the bacon fat in a 9 or 10-inch cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400° with the skillet inside. (If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven or a metal cake pan.)\n2 Whisk together all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter.\n\n3 When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully, as the handle will be hot!). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.\n4 Let the bread rest for 10-30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nTo avoid burning your hand because you've forgotten the pan is hot, I recommend placing a pot holder on the pan's handle while the cornbread is resting, or cooling the handle down a bit with an ice cube.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Anytime you put the words “Southern” in front of a dish, it’s likely to stir up controversy, and cornbread is no exception. It seems like every person I’ve ever known from the South has their favorite way of making it, and every way is different. But the thing that distinguishes Southern cornbread from, say Yankee cornbread, or any other cornbread one is likely to eat outside of the southern states, is that it is savory, not particularly sweet, and it is made mostly with cornmeal. Northern cornbreads tend to be more cake-like, on the sweet side, with a finer crumb due to more flour in the mixture. Southern cornbread is flavored with bacon grease, and cooked in a cast iron skillet, a perfect side for barbecues, or chili.\n\nWith this recipe we experimented with all cornmeal or just three quarters cornmeal and one quarter flour. We also experimented with including or leaving out an egg. Either way works, though the version with some of the cornmeal swapped out with flour, and including an egg, holds together better and is a little more tender.\nWhether to include sugar or not in a southern cornbread recipe is an issue for debate. We’ve included as an option a tablespoon or two which I think just intensifies the flavor of the cornmeal; it doesn’t make the cornbread sweet. The choice is yours as to whether or not to include it.\nYou’ll notice there are bacon drippings and butter in this recipe. The butter adds needed richness to the bread itself, and the bacon drippings help brown the crust, keep it from sticking to the skillet, and add a lovely bacon flavor to the bread.\nFinally, the method that works best with using a cast iron skillet is to preheat the skillet with the fat and then add the batter to the hot skillet. This helps brown the crust and with the pan already hot, the cornbread cooks more quickly.\nTo my fine readers from our Southern states, how do you like your cornbread? Please let us know in the comments.\n
449	Fesenjan Persian Chicken Stew with Walnut and Pomegranate Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 First toast the walnuts. You can do that one of two ways. You can either spread them out in a single layer in a large skillet, and toast them on medium high heat, stirring frequently until lightly toasted, or you can spread them out in a single layer in a baking rimmed baking sheet, and toast at 350°F in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. In either case, once toasted, remove from heat and allow to cool. Once cool enough to handle, pulse in a food processor or blender until finely ground.\n\n2 In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, pat the chicken pieces dry again and place the chicken pieces in the pan, working in batches if necessary to not crowd the pan, and cook until golden brown on all sides. Sprinkle the chicken with salt while they are cooking.\n3 Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the chicken from the pan, set aside. Add a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of oil to the pan. Lower the heat to medium low. Add chopped onions to the pan and sauté until translucent, stirring on occasion to release the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.\n\n4 Return the chicken pieces to the pan with the onions. Pour 2 cups of chicken stock over the chicken and onions. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes.\n\n5 Stir in the ground walnuts, pomegranate molasses, sugar, and spices. Cover and cook on very low heat for 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes or so to prevent the walnuts from sticking to the bottom of the pan.\n6 Remove from heat and adjust sugar/salt to taste. At this point the chicken should be fall apart tender.\nGarnish with pomegranate seeds. Serve over parsi pulao or other favorite rice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Fall is here, and in our little corner of Sacramento, that means walnuts and pomegranates. First the walnuts make an appearance, dropping cleanly out of their thick green husks. If the neighborhood crows are lucky, walnuts will bounce onto the pavement to be run over by passing cars, yielding an instant feast for the birds. If not, the crows will scoop up whole walnuts in their beaks, fly high and drop them, hoping the nuts crack open when they hit the ground.\nNext to ripen are the pomegranates. With the shorter days the pomegranates become ruby red, but that doesn’t mean they’re ready. It’s when they start to crack open, revealing the jewels inside, that it’s time to pick.\n\nWhen my friend Kerissa Barron was over the other day and suggested that we make her favorite Fesenjan, a Persian chicken stew with a sauce of toasted walnuts and pomegranate molasses, I couldn’t wait to try it. I never would have thought to make a sauce with walnuts and pomegranates, but it’s a perfect combination. The toasted walnuts are rich and warm and the pomegranate molasses sharp and berry toned. Cooked slowly with the chicken, the sauce is spectacular. Bowl-licking good.\nThe only ingredient that might be a little unusual is the pomegranate molasses. You can make your own with pomegranate juice, some sugar and lemon juice (see our recipe for pomegranate molasses), or look for it at Whole Foods or a store that carries Middle Eastern ingredients.\n
450	Sesame Brittle	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Put the sugar, honey, salt, nutmeg, and water into a small (1 1/2 quart), thick-bottomed saucepan. Heat on medium heat and stir until a smooth slurry is formed. Stir in the raw sesame seeds.\n2 Cook the sesame seed mixture, stirring often, until the mixture turns an amber caramel color, about 5 to 10 minutes. If you have a candy thermometer, the temp should be 300°F. At this point, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the vanilla extract and the butter. Once the butter has completely melted into the mixture, stir in the baking soda. The mixture will foam up a bit after you stir in the baking soda, as the baking soda reacts with the acid from the caramelization of the sugar.\n\n3 Pour the mixture out onto a Silpat-lined baking sheet. (If you don't have Silpat, no worries, pour directly onto a buttered metal baking sheet and use a metal spatula to separate brittle from the pan once cooled.) Once completely cooled and hardened (about 15-20 minutes), break into pieces.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mother and I share a secret (well maybe not so secret) indulgence. Sesame brittle. Our local health food store almost always has it available, and sometimes we’ll make a trip to that store to buy whatever, it doesn’t matter, the real reason is to satisfy a hankering for sesame brittle.\nNow that I’ve discovered how easy it is to make, I think mom and I are doomed.\n\nBefore, we at least had to make the effort to drive a few miles to get our fix. Sigh. Well at least I’ll have someone to share it with when I make a batch!\nSpeaking of which, this must be one of the easiest things in the world to make. All you really need is raw sesame seeds, sugar, and honey. A pinch of salt will add a little sparkle, as will a little nutmeg, butter and vanilla. A little baking soda will help create tiny pockets of air, making the brittle a little lighter. You can easily make a batch in less than 15 minutes, with maybe another 15 or 20 to cool. You don’t even have to toast the sesame seeds first. Cooking them in the honey and sugar will brown them sufficiently.\n
451	Beer Braised Chicken and Onions	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Melt the butter in a large, heavy pot with a lid, such as a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and set them skin side down in the butter. Salt the meat side lightly. Brown the chicken on both sides well. Remove the browned thighs from the pan and set aside in a bowl.\n\n\n\n2 The chicken skin has likely rendered quite a bit of fat. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pan, taking care to not discard any of the tasty browned bits.  (Note, do not discard the fat down the drain, you may clog your plumbing. Pour off into a jar.) Lower the heat to medium and add the sliced onions to the pan.  If you want, sprinkle brown sugar over the onions. This is optional. The added sugar will intensify the natural sweetness of the onions. Cook the onions slowly, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown, about 15 minutes.\n\n3 Add the bay leaves, thyme, mustard, 2 teaspoons of salt, and beer to the onions. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken thighs and the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. \n\n\n\n4 Cook covered for 45 minutes, then uncover the pot and simmer well until the liquid is greatly reduced and the meat wants to fall off the bone, between 45 minutes and 1 hour.  If you are using unsalted or low sodium stock, you will likely need to add more salt.  Add freshly ground black pepper and more salt to taste.\n\nServe over egg noodles or with rice or potatoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s hard to believe that a week ago we still had 100° highs here in Sacramento. Now it’s finally starting to feel like fall, and even though I’m still wearing shorts around the house (call it denial), the flip flops are gone and warm wooly socks have taken their place. It’s time for stews and slow braises like this one, rich, savory, and warming. This beer braised chicken is a riff off a classic Belgian carbonnade, a slow braise with sweet, malty dark beer, mustard, with chicken thighs smothered in onions.\n \nThe thing to note is that you can’t use any old beer. You want a dark beer, a “malty” beer, one that has richness and body, and sweet notes. The beer cooks down with the stock and mustard, forming a beautiful sauce for the finished dish.\nFor those of you who are avoiding alcohol, you may be able to find an non-alcoholic beer that works for this recipe, perhaps Kaliber from Guinness, or Erdinger Weissbier.\n
452	Baked Shrimp with Tomatillos	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat oil in the pan you will use for baking. Add the onions and jalapeños, cook for 5 minutes on medium high until the onions begin to brown. Add the garlic and cook a minute more. Add the tomatillos, reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes, until the tomatillos are cooked through, but still hold their shape. Sprinkle salt over the tomatillos as they are cooking.\n2 If using clam juice, add to pan, turn up the heat and reduce by half. If using water, just add the 1/4 cup of water without reducing.\n3 Add the cheese and shrimp. Cook in a preheated 425°F oven for 10 minutes.\n4 Remove pan from the oven. If using a pan with a handle, such as a cast iron frying pan, I recommend cooling the handle with ice for safety; it's so easy to forget that pan has just come out of the oven, and you grab the hot handle by mistake. Right before serving, mix in the cilantro and sprinkle with lime juice and freshly ground black pepper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	From the recipe archive, first posted 2010.\nSome things taste so much better than they look. This is an odd looking dish with the orangey pink shrimp and the light yellow-y green tomatillos, speckled here and there with white Cotija cheese and green cilantro. And you might be thinking, what kind of combination is that? But hear me out. This odd assortment of ingredients is just a Southwestern riff off a shrimp saganaki, which is typically made with feta and tomato sauce. One of the best received recipes on this site is for baked shrimp in tomato feta sauce. It just works. The onions and the shrimp provide the sweetness, the tomatillos or tomatoes the acidity, the Cotija queso seco or feta the saltiness, and the cilantro or parsley the bitter. Wrap some in a flour tortilla and you practically have a shrimp quesadilla with salsa verde.\n
453	Okra Pilau	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Spread the chopped bacon out in a pot so it covers the bottom completely and turn the heat to medium. Fry it until it's crispy, then remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve. Drain off all but about 2 tablespoons of bacon fat.\n\n\n\n2 Add the onion and green pepper and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the okra and turn the heat to high. Add the cayenne, salt and rice and stir-fry for 1 minute. \n\n3 Stir in the chicken broth, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook until the rice is done, about 20 minutes. Fluff up the rice with a fork and stir in the chopped bacon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Okra love. Okay, I admit it, I have a mad crush on this vegetable. From okra pickles to okra and tomato stir-fry, I’m finding every excuse to make something with okra. It just tastes so good! Sort of like the best tasting green bean, but even better. And the okra plants, new to my garden this year, are thriving, putting forth pods to pick every other day.\nThis okra rice pilaf recipe, known as okra pilau, is a southern staple, particularly of South Carolina, in whose swampy lands rice has been cultivated since colonial days. It’s simple; you just render bacon fat, cook chopped onions, peppers, and okra briefly in it, add rice, stock, and cook until done. Stir in chopped cooked bacon at the end. Whatever sliminess the famously slimy okra produces while cooking gets absorbed by the rice, and what you’re left with is just lovely okra, and okra and bacon infused rice.\n \nEver make something that you don’t want to share because you just want to keep it all for yourself? Yeah. This is one of those.\nFrom what I understand (if there are any South Carolinians out there, please advise me if I’m off base here) shrimp, sausage, and/or black eyed peas are often added to the pilau, making for a more substantial meal than what I’m presenting here. The dish is also curiously known as “Limpin’ Susan”, but I can find no reference to the etymology of that name.\nIf you love bacon and rice and have been sitting on the fence about okra, this is the recipe to try. I think you will be pleased.\n
454	Honey and Lemon Tea	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPut honey and lemon juice into a tea cup or mug. Add hot water and stir. Add more lemon juice, honey, or hot water to taste.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I have a cold. At first I thought the sneezing was due to allergies, but then it didn’t go away and I felt rotten, which is what happens when one has a cold. Achooo!!\nWhen I get a cold, I try to remember the laundry list of things that make it all better. Drink lots of water. Check. Take zinc and vitamin C. Check. Take omega 3 fish oil (helps boost immune system). Check. Take elderberry syrup (it’s antiviral). Check. Keep warm. Check.\nAnother thing on the list that is especially comforting when one has a cold is a hot cup of honey and lemon tea. Well, strictly speaking, there’s no “tea” in the tea. It’s just honey, lemon juice, and hot water. But it’s so good, especially if you have a cough or congestion. The lemon juice helps cut through congestion and the honey soothes the throat. \nYou can also add fresh ginger to your honey and lemon tea. Sometimes I’ll just have the hot water over ginger. That’s good too. But usually, it’s just honey and lemon. Now please excuse me while I catch up on the last thing on the list—rest. Peace out. ~Elise\n \n
493	Quince Jelly	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Stage of Cooking\n\n1  Put quince pieces in a large stockpot with a thick bottom and add water (if you are eyeballing it, put in enough water to cover the pieces of quince by about an inch.)\n\n2 Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, until the quince pieces are soft.\n\nMashing the pulp3 With a potato masher, mash the quince to the consistency of slightly runny applesauce.  Add more water if necessary.  If the mash is too thick, you won't get enough juice out of it.\n\nGeorge testing the consistency of the quince pulp\n\nStraining juice from pulp with cheesecloth\n\n4 To strain the juice from the pulp, place a metal strainer over a pot.  Drape 2 layers of cheesecloth over the strainer. (Can skip the cheesecloth if you are using a fine mesh strainer).  Ladle the pulp into the cheesecloth.  You may need to have two strainers set up this way.  Let the pulp strain for 3 to 4 hours.  If you aren't getting enough juice out of the pulp, you may need to mix more water into the mash.\n\nMeasure the juice and add sugar\n\nWatching the thermometer5 Measure the amount of juice you have.  Should be about 4 to 5 cups.  Pour into a thick-bottomed pot on the stove and bring to a boil.  Measure out the sugar - a little less than a cup for every cup of juice.  Add sugar to the juice.  \n\nSecond stage of cooking\n\n6 Bring to a boil, initially stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved, so that the sugar does not stick to the bottom of the pan.  Insert a candy thermometer to monitor the jelly temperature.\n\nWhat the juice looks like before it cooks\n\nSkimming the foam7 As the jelly cooks, skim off the foam that comes to the surface with a spoon.\n\n8 As the jelly is boiling, in a separate pan, melt some parafin wax for a seal and sterilize jars for canning.\n\n9 As the temperature rises above the boiling point of water (212°F), you will notice the consistency of the jelly/juice begins to change.  When the temperature is approximately 8 degrees higher than boiling point at your altitude (anywhere from 220°F to 222°F at sea level) the jelly is ready to pour into jars.\n\nLeft: Jelly is too runny.  Right: Jelly is wrinkling when pushed, which means it's ready.\n\nNote that candy thermometers aren't always the most reliable indicators of whether or not a jelly is done.  Another way to test is put a half teaspoonful of the jelly on a chilled (in the freezer) plate.  Allow the jelly to cool a few seconds, then push it with your fingertip.  If it wrinkles up, it's ready.\n\nBoiling\n\nAlmost done\n\nCanning\n\n10 There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.\n\n11 Use a large ladle to pour the jelly into the sterilized jars to 5/8 inch from the top rim of the jar.  Pour in enough melted parafin to add a 1/4 inch layer of wax.  The parafin will float to the top, cool, and harden forming a seal over the jelly as it cools.  (If you aren't using parafin, use canning jars with canning lids.  Sterilize the lids by letting them sit in just boiled hot water for a few minutes.  You will hear a popping noise as a vacuum seal is created as the jars of jelly cool.)\n\nSealing with parafin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Quinces are rather odd fruit; they look half-way between an apple and a pear, they are not good to eat off the tree, they are quite hard, they are loaded with pectin (a natural jelling agent), and they make the most lovely rose-colored jelly. My friend George has a quince tree in his yard and every year makes a batch or two of quince jelly. This year he invited me to make some with him, yum! This is how George make his jelly.\n
455	Turkey Soup with Lemon and Barley	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy pot or Dutch oven. Add the grated onion and cook until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the chopped garlic and cook another minute, then mix in the turmeric, cumin, ground ginger and a generous pinch of salt.\n2 Pour in the lemon juice and turkey stock and add the strips of lemon zest. Bring to a simmer, then add the barley. Simmer gently until the barley is cooked, about 20-30 minutes.\n3 When the barley is cooked through, add the chopped turkey, the parsley and cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook gently just until the turkey is warmed through, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the lemon zest strips before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Like turkey soup but want to change things up a bit this year with your turkey leftovers? Now here’s a detour from tradition, a riff on a classic Middle Eastern lemon chicken soup. The strong flavor of turkey meat holds up beautifully to the acidic lemon and bright turmeric, cumin, and ginger spices. The addition of barley gives the soup body. We used turkey stock from the carcass of a roast turkey, but you could easily use chicken stock.\n
456	Vegetarian Spinach and Mushroom Lasagna	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Place mushrooms in a large (6 to 8 quart), sauté pan on high or medium high heat. Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak. Sprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called "dry sautéing.) Once the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.\n\n2 Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Sauté the mushrooms and onions for about a minute.  Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms.  Add the large can of crushed tomatoes.  Add one cup of water. Stir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now.  Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.\n\n3 Once sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water.  (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil. When the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water.  As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other. Prepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets. Place the lasagna noodles on the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.\n\n\n4 Turn off the heat on the stovetop for the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go through this step.) Place a layer of lasagna noodles down over the tomato sauce, slightly overlapping. (For our 10x15-inch dish, we ultimately fit 3 layers of noodles, each layer with 6 noodles.  Then we had 2 extra noodles on which to nosh.) Sprinkle half of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Sprinkle half of the defrosted, drained, and excess moisture squeezed out spinach over the ricotta.  Sprinkle half of the Mozzarella cheese over the spinach, and just a quarter of the pecorino cheese. Then spoon 1/3 of your mushroom sauce over the Mozzarella. Sprinkle half of the fresh basil over the sauce if using.\n\n5 Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and Mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the Mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil.  Layer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.\n6 Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges.  Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.\nTake the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Once made, the lasagna will last a week in the fridge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have a large crowd gathering for the holidays? Or did you sign up to bring a main dish to a pot luck feast? Consider a lasagna. It’s hearty, filling, and feeds a multitude. People will love you if you bring a lasagna. (Or they should love you if they have any idea how much work goes into making one.) Be warned though, if you bring a lasagna that is especially good, they may ask for it again, for every pot luck, or for every holiday feast. They’ll get that puppy dog look in their eyes when they look at you and say, “oh, how about that lasagna, it’s so good, could you bring that?” And you’ll be slightly annoyed because, perhaps you were hoping to squeeze by with a simple potato salad, even though you signed up for a main. But then you’ll think about how good the lasagna is and how much you want some too, and then it’s just an excellent excuse to make it again.\n\nNow this particular lasagna is a vegetarian lasagna, which can be especially helpful around holiday meals when you are trying to figure out what to serve cousin Judy and uncle Joe who won’t eat turkey, goose, roast beef, or whatever the main meat dish is of the meal. And doubly helpful the days after the big feast when you still have friends and relatives around who need to be fed, and you don’t want to serve leftover turkey for every meal. This vegetarian lasagna fits that bill too, in that it is so filled with meaty shiitake and cremini mushrooms, spinach, and ricotta and Mozzarella cheeses, your meat-eating guests will be fighting for seconds with the vegetarians. Hopefully they’ll remember to leave some for you!\n
472	Pâté (Pate) Maison	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Grind all the meat (except the bacon) through a meat grinder twice.  Add remaining ingredients and mix well.  \n\n2 Line an 9x5x3 inch loaf pan with bacon strips and pack in the mixture.  Cover with bacon strips.  Place pan in a water bath, a larger pan that is filled halfway up the sides of the inner pan with water.  Bake at 350°F for 2 1/2 hours.  \n\n3 Remove from heat.  Cover with aluminum foil.  Place a weight such as a heavy brick on top while cooling.  Best to cool overnight in the refrigerator.  Slice and serve with bread or toast, lettuce and or tomatoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Easy to make liver pate recipe, made with chicken livers and pork sausage, wrapped in bacon, well seasoned with herbs and spices.

457	Candied Yams	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Get a large pot of water boiling and add a generous pinch of salt. Boil the sweet potatoes for 5-10 minutes, or until they are not longer crunchy; you will finish cooking them in a moment. Drain and set aside.\n\n2 Mix the remaining ingredients in a shallow, wide sauté pan and bring to a boil. Add the sweet potatoes and coat well with the sauce. Boil on high heat until the sauce reduces to a syrup, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Hank Shaw as he shares his mom’s favorite way of preparing garnet sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. ~Elise\nCandied yams have always been something of a mystery to me. Growing up, we only ever ate them on Thanksgiving, which was strange because they are such a perfect kid food: sweet, rich and tangy from the orange juice. And even on Thanksgiving, its sweetness was befuddling. Candied yams are like a little preview of dessert, a treat for the sweet tooth before the serious business of pies and ice creams begin in earnest.\nAs an adult, I now realize that candied yams properly occupy the middle position between the mashed potatoes and the cranberry sauce. Potatoes are starchy and rich with butter and cream, while the cranberry sauce is sweet and intensely tart. The yams borrow from each and by so doing bind the traditional Thanksgiving plate together.\nKnow that with a dish so classic as candied yams, there are as many ways to make it as there are cooks. This is how we made them at our house when I was growing up.\n
458	Roast Turkey Breast with Roasted Garlic Gravy	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Chop the turkey wings into pieces with a cleaver or heavy kitchen knife (or have your butcher do this for you). Coat the wings with some olive oil and salt well. Arrange in one layer in a roasting pan.\n\n2 Slice off the top 1/4 of the garlic heads and discard. Nestle the heads into some aluminum foil and drizzle the remaining olive oil over the garlic. Close the foil and place in the roasting pan with the turkey wings. Put the pan in the oven and roast for 45 minutes. Remove the garlic (do not unwrap), turn the turkey pieces and roast another 15 minutes.\n\n3 While the turkey wings are roasting, take the turkey breast out of its package, rinse under cool water and pat dry with paper towels. Let it sit out to come to room temperature.\n\n4 When the turkey wings are ready, place them in a medium pot and cover with water.  Add another cup of water to the roasting pan and scrape up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Add this to the pot with the turkey wings. Cover and simmer gently for 1 hour.\n\n5 Heat the oven to 425°F. Coat the turkey breast with the vegetable oil, then sprinkle it all over with salt. Sprinkle it as well with black pepper, thyme and sage. Place the turkey breast skin side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour 1 cup of water into the bottom of the pan (this will help prevent the oven from smoking). Put the turkey in the oven and cook for 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to 350°F and cook until the thickest part of the breast reads 155°F with a meat thermometer, about 80-90 minutes for a 6 to 7 pound breast. (Note that the internal temperature will continue to rise after you take the turkey out of the oven to rest.) To be on the safe side to keep from overcooking the turkey, check the internal temperature of the breast after one hour.\n\n6 Make the gravy while the turkey breast is roasting. Pour the turkey broth through a fine-meshed strainer into a bowl. Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a small pot and stir in the flour. Cook the butter flour mixture over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the mixture is the color of coffee-with-cream. Add the hot turkey broth to the butter flour mixture about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly. Stir in enough broth to make a thin gravy, about 2-3 cups. Squeeze all the garlic from the garlic heads into the gravy. Simmer gently while the turkey breast cooks, adding more turkey broth or water if the gravy gets too thick.\n7 When the turkey breast is ready, remove it from the oven, cover it with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving. Finish the gravy by pouring it into a blender and puréeing until smooth. Return the gravy to the pot and add salt and pepper to taste. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of butter to finish.\n\n8 To carve the turkey, cut straight down from the keel bone (the keel bone separates each half of the breast) until your knife hits the breast bone. Slice the meat off and, using short strokes with the knife, free the meat from the bone. If you want, pull off the tender underneath the breast and slice this piece separately; it tends to fall off the rest of the breast when you slice it anyway. Slice the deboned breast and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The way my brother Eddie tells it, he and a college friend decided to cook a turkey for Thanksgiving one year. The day before Thanksgiving, Eddie went out and bought a 25 pound turkey, frozen, and put it in the fridge to defrost. (Can you see where this is going?) When it came time to cook the turkey, he took it out of its plastic wrapping, only to discover that the bird was still completely frozen. Rock hard. Undaunted (due either to the unchecked optimism that accompanies that time in life, or to beer addled judgement, and probably a little of both), Eddie went about cooking the turkey anyway. Heck, what’s a little frozen meat that a hot oven can’t overcome?\nInto the oven it went. When it came time to eat, my brother pulled out of the oven a beautifully roasted, browned all over turkey. Success! thought my brother, hungry by now for the bird that had been roasting for several hours and filling the house with that wonderful aroma of Thanksgiving. A few friends had gathered as well, waiting for the feast to come. Then it came time to carve. Ed took out his longest, sharpest chef’s knife and aiming for the breast, cut in. Or tried to. As he tells it, he got about one inch in before the knife bumped up against rock hard, stone cold, frozen turkey.\nOr maybe it was a half inch.\nIn any case, from what I understand they gave up and went out for Chinese.\nThe obvious moral of this story is to allow your bird plenty of time to defrost. A 15 pound turkey will take about 3 days in the fridge to defrost, a 25 pound turkey, about 5 days.\nThe less obvious moral to this story, and the point of the following recipe, is why cook a 25 pound turkey when you are only feeding 4 to 5 people? Unless you want turkey leftovers for weeks, you might be better off cooking just a part of a turkey. In this recipe, we are cooking just the turkey breast, bone-in and skin-on, and making a rich, creamy gravy with drippings from a couple turkey wings.\n
494	Olive Crostini	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nChop olives in a food processor.  Transfer to medium bowl.  With machine running, drop garlic through the feed tube of the food processor and mince.  Add Parmesan, butter, and olive oil, and process into a paste.  Add butter mixture to bowl with olives.  Fold in jack cheese and parsley.  Cut baguette into thin slices and spread each slice generously with olive mixture.  Cook under broiler until bubbly and lightly browned - about 2 minutes.\n\n\n\nServe right out of oven.  Helps to make olive mixture in advance and spread right before you put in the oven.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here is a quick and easy appetizer, tasty and fun to make. Preparing these today for an afternoon barbeque I was assisted by my sous-chef Alden, of Carlisle, Massachusetts. Aldie is just about 6 years old and loves to help out; she is especially good helping me find things in an unfamiliar kitchen, opening cans of olives with the can opener, spreading olive paste on baguette slices, and serving the finished work to her guests. Thanks Alden and thank you Heidi (Alden’s mom) for the recipe!\n
459	Mashed Rutabaga with Sour Cream and Dill	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cover the chopped rutabaga with about 1 inch of cold water and bring to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and boil until tender, about 30-40 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.\n\n2 Reduce the heat to low and let the rutabaga steam for a minute or two. Mash with a potato masher.  Add the butter, sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Just before you serve, mix in the chopped dill or chives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Rutabaga. I just love saying that word. What’s a rutabaga? Well, it’s sort of a large turnip glancing in the direction of a sweet potato. It’s yellow in color on the inside, and tastes sort of like a turnip, but somewhat less bitter. It’s also called a “Swede” or a Swedish turnip. I don’t think you can escape Minnesota without having had your fair share of rutabagas, and my dad is no exception. He loves them. Tosses them into anything that calls for root vegetables. When I mentioned we were mashing up some rutabagas, he came by lickety-split, and then didn’t leave until he ate half of them. Yes, we love rutabagas here, and this mashed version is an excellent way to serve them.\nHow about you? Are you a rutabaga fan? If so, what’s your favorite way of serving them? Please let us know in the comments.\n\n
460	Clam Chowder	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse and scrub the clams to remove of any dirt. Place clams in a bowl, cover with cold water and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour. This will allow the clams to expel some of their grit into the water. Discard any broken clams or clams that are open and do not close when you touch them.\n\n2 Steam the clams. Place the clams in a large pot and add about a half inch of water to the pot. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Let the clams steam until they all open up, 5 to 10 minutes. The steaming water may foam up a bit, so watch so it doesn't overflow the pot. Use a slotted spoon to remove the clams from the pot to a bowl. Strain the remaining clam steaming liquid through a fine mesh sieve to catch any grit, and reserve. You should have 2 to 3 cups of clam liquid. Separate the clams from the clam shells. Discard the shells. Roughly chop the cooked clams.\n\n3 Place the salt pork and butter or oil in the bottom of a large, thick-bottomed pot. Heat on medium and brown the salt pork. (Note that if you are using salt pork that is mostly fat, you won't need any additional fat from butter or oil, but you might want to put a little water in the pan to help render the fat from the salt pork.)\n\n4 Add the chopped onion to the pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir until everything is coated with the flour. Let the flour cook for a minute or two. Slowly add the white wine to the pot, stirring after each addition.\n\n5 Add potatoes to the pot. Add 2 to 3 cups of the strained clam steaming liquid and a cup of water. The liquid should cover the potatoes. If not, add a little more, either water or clam cooking liquid. Add the bay leaf, thyme, black pepper, and Old Bay. Heat to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then add the corn (if using) and cook for 5 minutes more, or until the potatoes are cooked through.\n\n6 While the potatoes are cooking, heat a cup of cream in a small saucepan until steamy. When the potatoes are tender, add the chopped clams and turn off the heat of the soup. Slowly stir in the heated cream. Adjust seasonings. Stir in the fresh parsley.\nServe with oyster crackers or rustic bread.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Repeat after me, “Chow-DAH!” That’s the way it should be said, if you are anywhere in the vicinity of New England, which is the birthplace of this wonderful clam stew. The word “chowder” is thought to have been derived from “chaudière”, an old French term for cauldron, or a big cooking pot. Traditionally chowder is made with salt pork, onions, potatoes, milk or cream, butter, and fish like cod or haddock, or clams. Many of the older recipes add some wine (Madeira) as well. There’s a wonderful website I recommend called The New England Chowder Compendium which showcases a collection of historical chowder recipes dating back to the 1700s. Chowder is one of those things that is made in many different ways, and pretty much everyone thinks their way is best. It’s worth noting that the variations of this stew go back hundreds of years!\n\nOn a recent trip to Massachusetts, we sampled clam chowders at practically every stop. The best one we had, in my opinion, was at a little coffee shop in Concord, Mass. The soup was creamy, but not overly so (some clam chowders can be such cream bombs), thickened a little with flour, but not too much, and with tasty chunks of what appeared to be salt pork, and lots of corn in addition to chopped clams. I loved it! Corn isn’t usually included in clam chowder, but believe me, it’s fabulous.\nHere is my take on clam chowder, with plenty of suggestions for substitutions. Even my dad, who insists he doesn’t like clam chowder, loved this soup. Consider the recipe a guideline, and play with it to your liking.\nSpeaking of which, how do you like your clam chowder? Please let us know in the comments.\n
461	Pork and Poblano Stew	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Char the chile peppers on all sides, directly over a gas flame, or broil, turning every minute or so until the chiles are blackened on all sides. Place in a bowl and cover with a clean dish towel. Let sit for 10 minutes or so, then rub off the blackened charred skin. Cut away and discard the stem, seeds, and internal veins. Roughly chop the chiles into 1 to 2 inch pieces. Set aside.\n\n2 Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven on medium high heat. Pat dry the pork pieces with a paper towel and brown them, working in batches as to not crowd the pan. Sprinkle salt generously over the pork while they brown.\n3 Remove the pork from the pan and set aside. Add the chopped onion and cumin to the pan and cook about 5 minutes, until translucent. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan while the onions cook. Add garlic and cook for a minute more.\n\n4 Add the chopped chipotle to the onions and garlic. Return the browned pork to the pan. Add the chopped poblano chiles to the pan. Add the chicken stock and oregano. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and let cook for 1 hour. After an hour, add the diced sweet potato and corn to the stew. Cook for another half hour to 45 minutes, until the pork is tender and the sweet potatoes are cooked through.\nTo serve, spoon out the stew into bowls. Swirl in a spoonful of sour cream to each bowl. Top with chopped fresh cilantro and toasted shelled pumpkin seeds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every time I look at a picture of this pork and poblano stew I want to eat it all over again. This is one of those lick-every-last-drop stews, so good! Here we are, the first week of November, and we still have poblanos in the garden. Every few days I pick a few chiles, char them over direct flame on the gas stove, let them steam a bit in their own heat, and then scrape off the char. Usually we eat them right away, sometimes just with some olive oil and salt drizzled over, or wrapped in a warmed corn tortilla with a little cheese. This time though, we decided to make pork stew with the poblanos, a stew reminiscent of pozole, but with corn and sweet potatoes instead of hominy. Swirling in a spoonful of Mexican crema or sour cream right before serving makes the stew just lightly creamy and provides a soothing balance to the mildly spicy chiles.\n
462	Colombian Chicken Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put the chicken, diced russet potatoes, chopped onion and garlic in a large (at least 8 quart) stock pot and add 1 1/2 quarts of water and the quart of chicken stock.  Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat to a vigorous simmer. Add the cumin, bay leaves and salt to taste. Simmer this until the meat wants to fall of the bones of the chicken — anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour, 15 minutes. \n\n2 When the chicken is ready, remove it and the bay leaves from the soup and set in a large bowl. If you are going to puree the soup base with an immersion blender or by putting the soup into a regular blender in batches, do so now. \n\n3 Pour the pureed soup base back into the pot and bring to a very gentle simmer. Add the second batch of potatoes and cook until tender, about 20-40 minutes, depending on size.  \n\n4 While the potatoes are cooking, shred the meat off the chicken bones and set aside. Make the salsa by pulsing all the ingredients in a food processor until they're finely minced.  Transfer to a serving bowl.\n\n5 Drop the pieces of corn on the cob into the simmering soup and cook for 5 minutes. \n\n6 Serve the soup with the salsa, capers, sliced avocados, sour cream, and cilantro in separate bowls.  Let people add garnishes to their own servings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated May 5, 2011. \nThis is our version of a Colombian recipe (Ajiaco) that hinges on using several different kinds of potatoes, which are native to South America. The soup is served with a variety of garnishes, including a special salsa, “Aji”, that for us, truly defines the dish.\n \nAjiaco soup has all sorts of variations, but they all seem to rely on potatoes — some of which are cooked so long they dissolve, thickening the soup — corn (usually on the cob), and chicken. We decided to finely dice russet potatoes so they would dissolve quickly, and we pureed the soup base with an immersion blender, which saved hours of cooking time. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can either puree the soup base in a blender, or just cook it until the diced potatoes dissolve. \nIt’s important to use bone-on pieces of chicken here, as they are both cheaper and will make your soup broth more flavorful. \nGarnishes are up to you. They almost always include capers, avocados and cilantro, and will often include a salsa or a crema, which, depending on your perspective is either thin sour cream or a thick regular cream. \nWe used tiny, multi-colored potatoes to finish the dish, but you can use any mix of potatoes — just make sure to not use all russets. Red skinned potatoes, purple potatoes, fingerlings and small Yukon Golds are all good choices. \n
463	Liver Pâté	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariation: Use chicken livers, pork, and sausage meat in equal quantities. See my second recipe for pâté maison.\n\nGrind the pork through a meat grinder several times on a fine setting.\nPlace in a blender cognac or brandy, Madeira or sherry, garlic, parsley, shallot or onion, ginger, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg. Add diced livers and blend a cupful at a time. Season with salt and pepper, adding a dash of Tabasco or cayenne. Mix the ground pork with the blended liver.\n\nLine a 4x8-inch terrine with strips of bacon, fill with mixture, and cover with bacon. Place the terrine in a larger baking dish and fill the larger dish with water up to the halfway point on the side of the pâté dish. This "water bath" will help the pâté retain moisture and make for a smoother consistency in the texture.\n\nBake uncovered in a moderate oven, 350 degrees F, for about 1 1/2 hours. Cool the pate under a weight so that it will become firm and fine-textured. To do this, lay a piece of waxed paper or aluminum foil over the pâté and set on top of the entire surface a board weighted with a heavy object. Chill in the refrigerator for several hours.\n\nAt serving time bring the terrine to the table, slice, and serve with crusty French bread or rolls and a glass of wine. Also good with lettuce and tomatoes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I love baked liver pâté, or “pâté maison” as it is sometimes called. It is especially good with French bread and sweet pickles.\n
464	Bavarian Sauerkraut	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlace sauerkraut in a pot.  Add wine, onion, apple, juniper berries, salt, pepper and oil.   Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, until the onions are soft.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of our favorite side dishes is hot sauerkraut, delicious served with pork or bockwurst – a mild German sausage. You can also make a sandwich with toasted or grilled dark rye bread, melted Jack, havarti, or Muenster cheese, the sauerkraut, and avocado.\n
465	Braised Turkey Legs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Sprinkle turkey thighs and legs with salt and pepper.  Brown the turkey thighs and legs on medium high heat in a little bit of olive oil in a large sauté pan with high sides. Add chopped onion and celery to form a nest under the turkey pieces.  Sauté an additional 5 minutes.\n\n2 Add enough braising liquid - either water, stock, wine, or a combination - so that the liquid covers the bottom inch of the pan, about 1 cup.  Bring to a simmer.  Lower heat and simmer covered for an hour and a half, or until the turkey is so well cooked and tender that the meat easily falls off of the bones.  Remove the turkey meat from the pan and remove the bones, taking special care to remove the many small narrow bones of the legs.  Remove the skin.\n\nOptional:  At this point you can use the liquid remaining in the sauté pan to cook the potatoes, carrots and turnips.  Add the vegetables to the pan and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.  Cook covered until they are done, about 20 minutes.  Remove from pan so you can reduce the remaining liquid without overcooking the vegetables.\n\n3 Reduce the liquid remaining in the pan to intensify some of the meat juices for added flavor.  Take a teaspoon of cornstarch and dissolve in a 1/2 cup of water.  Add cornstarch mixture a little at a time to sauce, adding more liquid, until the sauce achieves the desired body.  Adjust seasoning.  Add salt and pepper if needed, add a little cayenne or Tabasco sauce.  If the sauce is too sweet, add a little vinegar or lemon.  Add parsley.\n\n4 Add the turkey meat back in the pan with the sauce.  Serve immediately over rice or bread or with the vegetables if you have chose to make them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Everybody loves turkey breast for their turkey sandwiches but the more flavorful meat comes from the dark meat found in turkey thighs and legs. These, by the way, are much less expensive than the breasts. Mom and dad have a great way of preparing braised turkey legs, perfect for a cold winter day.\n
466	Bouillabaisse	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large (6-qt) saucepan.  When it is hot, add onions and shallots (or leeks).  Sauté for a minute, then add crushed garlic (more or less to taste), and sweet red pepper.  Add tomato, celery, and fennel.  Stir the vegetables into the oil with a wooden sppon until well coated.  Then add another 1/4 cup of olive oil, thyme, bay leaf, cloves and the orange zest.  Cook until the onion is soft and golden but not brown.\n\n2 Cut fish fillets into 2-inch pieces.  Add the pieces of fish and 2 cups of water to the vegetable mixture.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes.  Add oysters, clams or mussels (though these may be omitted if desired) and shrimp, crabmeat or lobster tails, cut into pieces or left whole.\n\n3 Add saffron, salt, pepper.  Add clam juice, lemon juice, and white wine.  Bring to a simmer again and cook about 5 minutes longer.\n\n4 At serving time taste and correct the seasoning of the broth, adding a little more salt or pepper if need be, and maybe a touch of lemon juice.  Into each soup bowl place a thick slice of crusty French bread, plain or slighlty toasted.  Sppon the bouillabaisse over the bread.  If desired, serve with Sauce Rouille. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	According to tradition, there should be at least five different kinds of fish in a proper bouillabaisse. In Marseille, considered the mecca of bouillabaisse, they use at least seven, not counting the shellfish. The fish should be extremely fresh – caught and cooked the same day. If you cannot get extremely fresh fish, then the next best alternative is quick frozen – fish frozen the same day it was caught. Use as many different types of fish as you can, such as fillets of flounder, haddock, cod, perch, white fish, whiting, porgies, bluefish, bass – almost any combination. Count on at least three kinds to serve six.\n
489	Suzanne’s Chocolate Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCake:\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F.\n\n1 In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and cocoa.  \n\n2 Add 1 cup and 2 tablespoons of water and 1 cup and 2 tablespoons of canola oil.  Mix for 1 minute.\n\n3 Add eggs, 3/4 cup of water, vanilla.  Mix 5-6 minutes with a whisk, 3-4 minutes with a hand mixer, or 2 minutes with a KitchenAid mixer.\n\n4  Pour into three 10" cake pans, bake at 350°F for 25-35 minutes (adjust for convection); test by placing and removing a toothpick through the center at 25 minutes.  When toothpick comes out clean, loosen from pans and then put back in the pans.  Let cakes cool for 15 minutes.  Keep in the pans, wrap in foil, and put in the freezer for at least 2 hours.\n\nFrosting:\n\nThis part is a little harder as it is really done to taste.\n\n1 Put powdered sugar and 3/4 cup cocoa into a food processor.  Pulse until blended.  \n\n2 Drizzle in, until about the consistency of firm butter, several tablespoons of flavoring liquid (water if you aren't looking for flavor beyond the cocoa and butter).  To not put in too much liquid, but if you do, add cocoa or sugar.  Taste.  When the flavor and consistency is right,\n\n3 add 1 1/2 cup of butter (firm, not cold and not too soft).  A good rule of thumb is that both the butter and the sugar mixture should be slightly firmer than you would want it to be to spread it, since the mixing action of the food processor will warm it slightly.  Pulse until blended.\n\nAssembling the cake:\n\nRemove the cakes from the freezer and from their pans.  Stack, frosting each layer as you go.  Let sit for an hour before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Suzanne served in the Peace Corps for two years in Kenya in the late Eighties. The Peace Corps at that time published a recipe book for their volunteers that provided a chocolate cake recipe that was special in that one could mix it in one pot, use vegetable oil, which was more readily available than butter, and cook in the same pot over a charcoal brazier. Suzanne perfected the recipe, especially for cooking over the brazier, and since she had the only home for miles around with a cement floor, a tin roof, and good water, she would often play hostess to nearby volunteers and serve them this cake (usually sans frosting).\nOnce Suzanne returned to the States, she then spent months of trial and error, and several burnt cakes, to adjust the recipe for oven cooking (and layering and frosting). It is now her family’s favorite cake, which they dub “Kenya Cake”. A rich, easy to make chocolate cake, with a great history. Thanks so much Suzanne!\n
467	Molasses Spice Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Mix together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice together in a bowl and set aside.\n\n2 Use an electric mixer and beat the butter for 2 minutes.  Add the brown sugar, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes with mixer set at medium speed.  Add egg, vanilla extract, and molasses.  Beat until combined, about 30 seconds.  Scrape down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula.\n\n3 Add dry ingredients and beat at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.\n\n4 Place remaining 1/3 cup of granulated sugar in a shallow bowl.  Working with 2 Tbsp of dough each time, roll dough into 1 3/4 inch balls.  Roll balls in sugar and place on ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart.\n\n5 Bake until the outer edges of the cookies begin to set and centers are soft and puffy, about 11 to 13 minutes.  Cool cookies on sheets for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring them to cooling racks .\n\nNote:  do not overcook.  The centers of the cookies should be somewhat soft and spongy when you take them out of the oven, otherwise they will end up hard and dry.\n\nOptional Glaze\n\nWhen cookies have cooled, lay out over a sheet of wax paper.  Sift 1 1/4 cups of confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar) and then whisk with 2 Tbsp of milk until smooth.  Dip spoon into glaze and dribble over cookies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Molasses spice cookies are sort of like ginger snaps except bigger and chewy. The recipe for these cookies comes from Cook’s Illustrated’s The Best Recipe cookbook. Here’s a hint on preparation – don’t reduce the amount of sugar, the cookies won’t be chewy if you do (I found this out the hard way and had to make a second batch).\n
468	Beet Greens	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Wash the greens in a sink filled with cold water.  Drain greens and wash a second time.  Drain greens and cut away any heavy stems.  Cut leaves into bite-sized pieces.  Set aside.\n\n2 In a large skillet or 3-qt saucepan, cook bacon until lightly browned on medium heat (or heat 1 Tbsp of bacon fat).  Add onions, cook over medium heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occassionally, until onions soften and start to brown.  Stir in garlic.  Add water to the hot pan, stirring to loosen any particles from bottom of pan.  Stir in sugar and red pepper.  Bring mixture to a boil.  \n\n3 Add the beet greens, gently toss in the onion mixture so the greens are well coated.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 5-15 minutes until the greens are tender.  Stir in vinegar.  (For kale or collard greens continue cooking additional 20 to 25 minutes or until desired tenderness.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	All these years I’ve been loving beets but throwing the beet greens away. Yikes! No more. This is a delicious way to serve greens, whether collard, kale, or beet.\n
633	Jalapeno Pepper Jelly	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n1 Combine the apple pieces, apple cores (needed for their pectin content), jalapenos, bell pepper, cranberries (if using), water and vinegar in a large pot.  Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low, simmering for about 20 minutes, or until the apples, cranberries, and peppers are soft. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan where it might burn. Use a potato masher to mash up the apple pieces to the consistency of slightly runny apple sauce.  If the mash is too thick, add more water.\n\n\n\n2 Spoon the mash into a fine mesh sieve, muslin cloth, or a couple layers of cheesecloth, suspended over a large bowl. Leave to strain for several hours (even overnight). If you want a clear jelly, do not squeeze or force through the mesh.  Just let it drip.  If you want a fuller flavor jelly and don't mind that the result won't be clear, you can force some of the pulp through the mesh.  If your pulp is too thick, and nothing is coming out, you can add an extra 1/2 cup or cup of water to it.  You want to end up with about 4 cups of juice. \n\n3 Measure the juice, then pour into a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot. Add the sugar (7/8 a cup for each cup of juice). Heat gently, stirring to make sure the sugar gets dissolved and doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.\n\n\n\n4 Bring to a boil. Cook for 10-15 minutes, using a spoon to skim off the surface scum. Continue to boil until a candy thermometer shows that the temperature has reached 220-222°F (8-10°F above the boiling point at your altitude).  Additional time needed for cooking can be anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or longer, depending on the amount of water, sugar, and apple pectin in the mix.\n\nLeft: Jelly is too runny.  Right: Jelly is wrinkling when pushed, which means it's ready.\n\nCandy thermometers aren't always the most reliable indicators of whether or not a jelly is done.  Another way to test is put a half teaspoonful of the jelly on a chilled (in the freezer) plate.  Allow the jelly to cool a few seconds, then push it with your fingertip.  If it wrinkles up, it's ready.\n\n5 Pour jelly into sterilized jars* to within 1/4" from the top and seal.  \n\nMakes approx. 4 half-pint jars.\n\nServe with cream cheese on crackers.\n\n*There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.\n\nNote that jalapeno jelly can be pretty "hot" if you have included a lot of the seeds in your cooking.  The fat molecules in the cream cheese absorb the hot capsaicin of the jalapenos, reducing the heat, but leaving the flavor of the chiles.  This is also why sour cream tastes so good with spicy Mexican food.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We love jalapeño chili peppers. We use them in so much of our cooking that I’ve taken to even pickling my own. For the last year I’ve been searching for a recipe for jalapeño jelly that didn’t rely on food dye or commercial pectin, but to no avail. So, with some experimentation, I’ve come up with the following recipe which uses apple jelly made from Granny Smith apples (the tart, green apples) as a base, and cranberries for color. Granny Smith apples (and cranberries too) have plenty of natural pectin, so no additional pectin is needed to make the jelly gel.\n
470	Peach Pâté Tartine	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake a freshly baked French baguette and slice or tear it in half. Take some pâté maison or "house pâté" and spread it over the bread. Take some soft mild brie cheese and spread it over the pâté. Take slices of sweet juicy white peaches or nectarines and arrange them on top of the cheese and pâté.\nThe sweetness of the peaches and nectarines provides a delicious balance to the strong flavors from the pâté and cheese. In this arrangement, all of your ingredients must be the best or it won't work. The bread must be fresh and soft. The pâté and brie mild. And the peaches and nectarines must be melt-in-your-mouth ripe and sweet.\nThis is the perfect summer sandwich, as white nectarines and peaches become ripe in July.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	21 years ago, in the summer of 1983, I took my first trip to Europe, including 2 weeks in and around Paris with my friends John and Heidi and their parents George and Jill. On one particularly beautiful day, on lovely patch of grass overlooking some glorious château (I don’t remember the name, only that it contained a Rafael and had a huge moat filled with thousands of carp fighting over the breadcrumbs tourists threw to them) John broke out a picnic basket including French red table wine, a fresh bagette, some pâté maison, some soft brie, and several white peaches and nectarines. We then proceeded to make and eat the most delicious open-face sandwiches with all of the ingredients combined, and washed them down with the wine.\nWhat is a Tartine? According to Clotilde of Chocolate and Zucchini, a tartine (pronounced “tarteen”) is an open faced sandwich – nicely arranged layers of yummy things on a slice of bread.\n
471	Candied Citrus Peel	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrapefruit skins are much thicker than other citrus skins.  Cooking them a while in boiling water helps loosen up the white pithy part so it is easier to scrape off.\n\n1 Scrub the outside rinds thoroughly to remove any dirt.  Put rind in cold water, bring to a boil and boil for 10 minutes.  Drain and repeat this process two more times.  Drain, rinse with cold water, and scrape away the pithy white part of the peel.  Slice into strips.  \n\n2 For each cup of rind, prepare a sugar syrup of 1 cup of sugar to 1 cup of water.  Put rind in syrup and cook slowly until syrup is completely absorbed - several hours.  Stir occassionally and watch carefully near the end of the process.  \n\n3 Cool the peel and coat the strips with granulated sugar.  Dry overnight on a rack.  The sugared peel, when dry, may be dipped into melted semisweet chocolate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When it’s citrus season here in Northern California our grapefruit, lemon, and orange trees are heavy with fruit. Taking inspiration from Il Forno’s wonderful blog entry on candied orange peel I decided to try my hand with some grapefruit peel. I followed a slightly different recipe than Il Forno, having dug one up from An Olde Concord Christmas. That recipe calls for the rinds to be soaked overnight in salt water. I’m not sure the purpose of this step, nor did I want to wait, so I skipped it. If anyone has a suggestion as to why soaking the rind overnight in salt water would benefit the process, please let me know!\n
473	Crab Mango and Avocado Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSauce directions:\nHeat the olive oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add the mango, season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes until the fruit is very tender. Add water, bring to a boil and remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice. Pour the mixture into a blender and purée until smooth. Chill.\nAlternatively, if you are pressed for time, put all of the sauce ingredients into a blender and purée.\nCrab salad directions:\n1 In a bowl add the crab meat, 2 tsp of the cilantro, 1 tsp of the mint, the chopped shallot, a Tbsp of lime juice, 2 Tbsp of olive oil, 10 drops of Tabasco sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix carefully with a fork, to avoid breaking up the larger lumps of crab meat. Set aside.\n2 In a separate bowl add the mango, avocado, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1/2 Tbsp of lime juice, the remaining cilantro and mint leaves, 10 drops of Tabasco, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix gently with a spoon, taking care not to mush the avocado pieces.\n3 Spoon some mango avocado mixture on to a chilled plate, gently mound some crab mixture over it. Garnish with cilantro leaves. For a tasty added touch if you have them, arrange peeled sections of sweet ruby red grapefruit around the salads. The grapefruit provides a flavorful complement to the crab salad.\nAlternatively you can use small tureens or desert bowls for individual molds, line the mold with plastic wrap, then layer the crab mixture and the mango avocado mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. When you are ready to serve, gently remove the salads from the molds onto individual plates. Serve the sauce on the side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I first encountered a crab mango salad at Fringale, the exquisite French-Basque restaurant on 4th St. in San Francisco. Recently at a restaurant in LA I had another delicious crab mango salad, this time with avocado and surrounded by peeled ruby red grapefruit sections. I’ve been dreaming about it ever since.\n
474	Dad’s Ratatouille	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Preheat oven to 400° F. 2  Using a large oven-proof pan over medium high heat, sauté onions in olive oil until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and reduce heat to low.\n\n3  While the onions and garlic are cooking over low heat, put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a another frying pan over high heat.  As soon as oil starts to smoke, quickly add enough zucchini cubes all at once to cover the bottom of the pan.  Keep on cooking over high heat, stirring, until zucchini is lightly browned on all sides.  Remove zucchini cubes, and add them to pan with the onions.\n\n4  Working in batches, repeat this process until all of the zucchini cubes have been cooked.  Do the same with the yellow squash.  Make sure to add a little olive oil between each new batch.  Continue with the bell peppers, then the eggplant cubes, adding the browned vegetables to the onion pan as soon as they are cooked.\n\n5 When all the vegetables (except the tomatoes) are browned and in the pan with the onions, increase the heat to high and stir, making sure they don't stick to the bottom of the pan.  Add salt to taste, thyme, bay leaf, and rosemary, the vegetable stock, and stir well.  Place in oven, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Alternatively you can cook them on the stovetop on low heat for 30 minutes.\n\n6  If using fresh tomatoes, boil water in a saucepan on stove.   Remove stems from tomatoes, and crisscross the bottoms with a knife.  Plunge into boiling water for a minute or two, until skin starts to fall away.  Rinse in cold water and remove skin.  Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise, remove seeds, chop coarsely, set aside.\n\n7  After the vegetables have been in the oven for a half hour, remove from oven, drain vegetables in a colander set over a bowl.  Clean browned bits (if any) off bottom of pan with a paper towel.  Return any liquid to the pan and reduce to a thick glaze over medium high heat.  Keep on adding juices to the pan as they run out of the vegetables into the bowl.\n\n8  When all the juices have been reduced, return vegetables to the heavy pan.  At this point the ratatouille should be moist and shiny, with very little liquid.  Turn heat off.   Add the chopped tomatoes and cover.  If serving as a warm side dish, let the ratatouille stand for 10 minutes, just enough to "cook" the tomatoes.  The ratatouille can be served at room temperature or refrigerated and reheated the next day.\n\n9  When ready to serve, remove the bay leaf, and season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Dad originally got this recipe from Dean & DeLuca, and over time it has become a family classic. Only he has the patience to make it. The recipe is little involved, but the results are fantastic. Luxuriously rich, smooth, and flavorful, this ratatouille is practically the best way I know of preparing vegetables that people can’t get enough to eat.\n
475	Quick and Easy Artichoke Dip	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Drain the artichokes from the can.  Coarsely chop them. \n\n2  Combine chopped chokes, Parmesan, and mayo into a microwave or oven-proof serving dish.  \n\n3  Microwave on high heat for 5 minutes, pausing occassionally to stir, to ensure that the dip gets heated evenly.  Add fresh ground pepper and salt to taste.\n\nServe with toasted, thinly sliced French baguettes, crackers, or even leaves of endive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This is one of the quickest, easiest, tastiest artichoke dip recipes around. All it takes is 3 simple ingredients, plus salt and pepper if you want, heated quickly in the microwave. Dress it up if you want, with garlic, chili pepper, or dill (other suggestions? please leave them in the comments), but it’s terrific just on its own too.\n
476	Chiles en Nogada (Chilies in Walnut Sauce)	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTHE NIGHT BEFORE\n1 Remove the papery bitter skins from the walnut pieces. (This is the hard part.) Sometimes the skins easily rub off. I have found that usually, for us, the skins don't easily peel off and we need to blanch them for one minute in boiling water first, to loosen the skins. If you blanch the walnuts, let them cool to the touch and carefully peel off as much of the bitter skins as you can. This is painstaking work, but unless your walnuts are shed of their bitter skins, the sauce may be a bit bitter.\n\n2 Place the walnuts in a bowl, cover them with milk to soak, and chill them overnight in the refrigerator.\n \nTHE DAY OF\nRoast the chiles:\n\n3 Place the chiles directly over the flame of a gas stove, or place under a hot broiler, to char the outside tough skin. Turn the chiles to char them on all sides. Get as much of the outside skin blackened as possible, it will be easier to remove that way. (See How to roast chile peppers over a gas flame tutorial using Anaheim chiles.)\n\n4 Place the blackened chiles in a bowl and cover with a plate or damp clean towel and let sit for 20 minutes. The burned skin will then flake off very easily and the flesh will become a little more cooked in the steam. Make a slit in the side of each chili and carefully remove the seeds and veins. Be careful to leave the top of the chili, the part around the base of the stem, intact. (A tip from Diana Kennedy: if you taste the chiles and they are too spicy hot, soak them in a mild vinegar and water solution for about 30 minutes.) Rinse the chilies and pat them dry.\n \nMake the walnut sauce:\n\n 5 Drain the walnuts. Place the soaked and drained walnuts, the queso fresco, sour cream, sugar, and cinnamon into a blender and purée until completely smooth.\n \nMake the picadillo stuffing:\n\n6 Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large wide saucepan on medium high heat. Working in batches to prevent crowding the pan, brown the meat on at least one side, sprinkling the meat with a little kosher salt as it cooks. Add another tablespoon of oil if needed for the subsequent batches. Remove meat to a bowl and set aside.\n\n7 Add a tablespoon of cooking oil to the pan and heat on medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the cinnamon, black pepper, cloves, and garlic and cook another minute.\n\n8 Melt butter in the pan and return the ground meat to the pan and use a wooden spoon to break up any clumps.  Add the crushed tomatoes, golden raisins, and chopped slivered almonds. If the mixture seems a little dry, add a tablespoon or two of water. Add chopped apple to the picadillo mixture. Adjust spices, add more cinnamon, salt, ground cloves to taste (go easy on the cloves, they can overpower).\n \nAssemble the chiles en nogada:\n10 Stuff the chilies with the picadillo until they are well filled out. Place them on individual plates or on a serving platter.\n\n11 To serve, cover the stuffed chiles with the walnut sauce and sprinkle with pomegranate arils and chopped fresh parsley or cilantro.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated Nov 14, 2013\nGuaymas Restaurant in Tiburon is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Northern California and their Chile Poblano is the best item on the menu. It is a green poblano chili stuffed with a picadillo and covered in a walnut creme sauce and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.\nChiles en Nogada (chilies in walnut sauce) is a classic Mexican dish, and is a specialty of the city of Puebla. Here’s what Diana Kennedy in her seminal The Cuisines of Mexico has to say about the dish:\nThe recipe is said to have been concocted by the grateful people of Puebla, who were giving a banquet in honor of Don Agustin de Iturbide’s saint’s day, August 28 in 1821. He and his followers had led the final revolt against Spanish domination; as self-proclaimed emperor he had just signed the Treaty of Cordoba. All the dishes at the banquest were concocted of ingredients of the color of the Mexican flag; in this dish were the green chilies, the white sauce, and the red pomegranate seeds.\n\nThe classic Mexican dish uses a pork picadillo with dried fruits and spices. Guaymas uses ground chicken. My adaptation of this recipe uses ground turkey. This dish is a bit involved, but the effort is worth it. It really is an extraordinary blend of flavors. If you ever get to Guyamas Restaurant in Tiburon, Mill Valley California, by all means order it! You won’t be disappointed.\n
477	Orange Cornmeal Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan with oil (can use butter for this too); line the bottom of the pan with wax paper or parchment paper, and brush the top of the paper with oil.\n2 In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, oil, 1 cup of the sugar, and orange juice until smooth. Add flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and orange zest; whisk lightly to combine.\n3 Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan; sprinkle the top evenly with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Bake until cake begins to pull away from sides of pan and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 25-35 minutes.\n4 Cool the cake in the pan 20 minutes. Run a knife around edge of cake to separate it from the edge of the pan. Invert the cake gently onto a plate, and remove the parchment paper. Re-invert the cake onto a rack to cool completely before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When we first came across this recipe in Martha Stewart’s Everyday Food magazine we had to try it out. We’ve made it several times now, and everytime with great results. It’s sort of a cross between a coffee cake and cornbread with a light orange flavor. Unexpectedly good. Light, moist, and not too sweet. Be careful not to overcook.\n
478	Egg Salad Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mash up the chopped egg a bit with a fork.  Mix together the chopped hard-boiled egg, mayonnaise, celery and onion.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and curry powder to taste.  Mix with a spoon.  \n\n2 Toast your bread slices.  Put a layer of lettuce on one  slice of toasted bread, spread the egg mixture on top of the lettuce, put another slice of toasted bread on top.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Egg salad sandwiches are some of the easiest sandwiches in the world to make, especially if you have some hard boiled eggs sitting around in the fridge (like around Easter). I’ve found the best combination for a great egg salad sandwich is using toasted rye bread, and including a dash of curry with the mayo, celery, green onions and egg of the egg salad. The amount of mayonnaise is really a matter of taste, it all depends on how mayo-y you want your sandwich. The dash of curry comes from a suggestion from my friend George R., ever since I learned this trick from him I add it every time. The curry just gives the egg salad a little unexpected lift.\n
479	Turnip Potato Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large, heavy, thick-bottomed pot, melt the butter on medium heat until it foams.  When the butter foam subsides, add the onions and cook until translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the sliced turnips and potatoes and stir to coat with the butter.  Add 2 teaspoons of salt, cover and reduce the heat to low.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the turnips and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.\n\n2 Add the chicken stock and increase the heat to bring to a simmer.  Cover partially and cook over medium heat until the turnips and potatoes are very tender, about 10 minutes.\n\n3 Working in batches, purée the soup in a blender until completely smooth.  Return the soup to the pot and season with salt and freshly grated nutmeg.  Ladle the soup into shallow bowls and garnish with the parsley before serving.\n\nServes 8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Church book sales are a great way to pick up cookbooks at bargain prices. Ours was last weekend and we found the Food and Wine Magazine’s 1999 Annual Cookbook for a dollar. What a deal! Most of the recipes in the book look ridiculously complicated, taking hours of preparation and needing ingredients that one might have difficulty finding even at Whole Foods. This one however, is simply turnips, potatoes, onions, stock, and butter. Unassuming, but surprisingly and exceptionally good, especially considering that the main ingredient is turnips. Don’t get me wrong, I love turnips. I have found however that most people don’t. There’s something about the blend of flavors in this soup that take the edge off of the bitter turnip flavor and produces a thick and creamy soup, yet without any cream.\n
480	Potato Spinach Sausage Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a 6x9 or 8x8 inch baking dish.\n2 Heat one of the teaspoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add spinach and cook, stirring often, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer spinach to strainer and drain. When cool, squeeze out liquid and roughly chop the spinach.\n3 Wipe skillet clean. Add sausage to skillet and cook over medium-high heat until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Use slotted spoon to transfer sausage to bowl. Wipe skillet clean. Heat remaining oil in skillet and add onions, cooking until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Scrape mixture into bowl with sausage.\n4 Meanwhile, place potatoes in a large pot and add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring potatoes to boil over high heat, then lower heat to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes, wipe pot dry, put potatoes back into the pot, and mash with butter, cream, vinegar, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Stir in spinach and 1/2 cup of the cheese.\n5 Transfer potato-spinach mixture to prepared baking dish. Top with sausage-onion mixture and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of cheese. Bake until potatoes are very hot and cheese is golden and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nServes 4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We are constantly trying out new recipes here at Casa Elise, and even jokingly refer to our kitchen as the “test kitchen”. However, many recipes never make it to this site because often they just aren’t good enough. In fact, some are downright awful. When we do find a good one, we declare it a “winner” and often make it again so I can get a good photo. This is one of those recipes. Not a big one for casseroles, I was surprised at how tasty this Potato, Spinach, and Sausage Casserole was. It comes from the charter issue of a new magazine put out by the folks at Cook’s Illustrated, called Cook’s Country, a magazine devoted to home cooking. Our changes were to make the casserole for four people instead of eight and to use both sweet and hot Italian sausage instead of the kind of sausage you slice. If you ever have a hard time convincing a family member to eat their spinach, this would be the recipe to use.\n
481	Buttery Apple Torte	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat an oven to 375°F (190°C).  Generously butter a 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pan with 2 inch (5 cm) sides.\n\n2 In a microwave, melt the butter. Pour 6 Tbsp (3 fl oz or 90 ml) of it into a small bowl or cup and set aside.  Add the apple slices and the remaining butter to a large frying pan and cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat.\n\n3 In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  In a large bowl, beat the whole eggs and egg yolk until blended.  Add the 6 Tbsp of melted butter, the vanilla, the granulated sugar, and the lemon zest.  Stir in the flour mixture and the apples.  Spoon into the prepared pan, smoothing the top.\n\n4 Bake until browned, 30-35 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes.  Invert the cake onto a plate and lift off the pan, then invert the cake again onto the rack and let cool completely.\n\n5 (Optional) Just before serving, place confectioners' sugar in a small sieve and dust the top of the cake.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This Italian apple torte is easy to make, and delicious. Cooking the apples first helps concentrate the flavor and remove moisture, so the cake doesn’t get soggy. The lemon zest, although only a half teaspoon is used, is an essential ingredient – you can really taste it in the apples.\n
482	Arugula Pesto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Brown 6 garlic cloves with their peels on in a skillet over medium high heat until the garlic is lightly browned in places, about 10 minutes.  Remove the garlic from the pan, cool, and remove the skins.\n\n2 Toast the nuts in a pan over medium heat until lightly brown, or heat in a microwave on high heat for a minute or two until you get that roasted flavor.  In our microwave it takes 2 minutes.\n\n3a Food processor method (the fast way):  Combine the arugula, salt, walnuts, roasted and raw garlic into a food processor.  Pulse while drizzling the olive oil into the processor.  Remove the mixture from the processor and put it into a bowl.  Stir in the Parmesan cheese.\n\n3b Mortar and pestle method:  Combine the nuts, salt and garlic in a mortar.  With the pestle, grind until smooth.  Add the cheese and olive oil, grind again until smooth.  Finely chop the arugula and add it to the mortar.  Grind up with the other ingredients until smooth.  \n\nBecause the pesto is so dependent on the individual ingredients, and the strength of the ingredients depends on the season or variety, test it and add more of the ingredients to taste.  \n\nServe with pasta, over freshly roasted potatoes, or as a sauce for pizza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We have a 3 ft by 6 ft patch of arugula growing in our garden and for the last two months I’ve been looking for ways to make use of it. By the way, arugula (a.k.a. rocket) grows like a weed and re-seeds itself every year. The bugs and snails don’t seem to touch it (they go for the lettuce instead). I had heard that walnuts are good in pesto so I tried making the arugula pesto both ways – one with pine nuts and one with walnuts. I think the arugula pesto with walnuts is better. The strong, meaty flavor of the walnuts balances out the astringency of the arugula, a good blend of flavors. I’ve made pesto both with mortar and pestle and with a food processor. The food processor method is definitely easier but the mortar method produces larger pieces of the arugula. \nI prefer a mild garlic flavor that you can achieve by using roasted garlic. The 1/2 raw garlic clove is added for a little kicker. The first time I made this pesto it was with only raw garlic and it was a little overwhelmingly garlicy. Using roasted garlic is a great way to still have the garlic flavor but without the intensity.\n
608	Salmon Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBreak cooked salmon into chunk sized pieces and add to bowl. Combine celery, red onion, capers, lemon juice, olive oil, fresh dill in a separate dish. Gently add the dressing mixture into the bowl of salmon, mixing just enough so all pieces are coated. Add a sprinkling of salt and ground pepper to taste. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to cool and to allow the flavors to blend.\nServe with a slice of lemon.\nFor best results, do not over-cook your salmon!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Hot days are upon us. A great way to cool off is with a refreshingly chilled salmon salad. This salad is also one way to use up leftover salmon from a summer barbecue. Easy and quick.\n
483	Grandma’s Sunshine Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Empty gelatin into a small mixing bowl.  Stir in 2 cup of boiling water.  Stir thoroughly until the gelatin has dissolved.\n\n2 Stir in 1 cup ice water, one can of crushed pineapple with its juice, lemon juice (or vinegar), and a pinch of salt.  (Make sure you use canned pineapple. Fresh pineapple has an enzyme that will prevent the gelatin from jelling.)\n\n3 Chill in refrigerator until the gelatin starts to thicken.  Then gently fold in the grated carrots until well mixed.\n\n4 Add mixture to a jello mold.  Set in the refrigerator until firm, several hours.  To unmold, dip the bottom of the pan in hot water for about 5 seconds.  Invert onto a serving platter, and shake firmly to release.  Slice to serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated\nYears ago, in the sixties, my grandmother came to live with us. She loved to bake, especially oatmeal raisin cookies and lemon meringue pie. She also loved to make Jell-O salads. As kids we loved Jell-O in all flavors. Who were we to wonder when my grandmother put things like cucumbers, horseradish, carrots, and or pineapple in with the Jell-O? One of her favorites was a Jell-O salad made with carrots and crushed pineapple. I had all but forgotten this salad until I met a woman at a counter at Logan Airport who told me about her favorite Jell-O salad, called a “Sunshine Salad”. This was it, grandma’s salad!\n
484	Suzanne’s Best Brownies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 325°F with rack positioned in the lower third of the oven.  Line the bottom and the sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with foil or parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides to make it easier to lift the brownies out of the pan when they are done.\n\n2 Combine the butter, cocoa, sugar, and salt in a medium heatproof bowl. Set the bowl in a wide skillet of barely simmering water. Stir the butter cocoa mixture from time to time until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth and hot enough that you want to remove your finger quickly after dipping it in to test. Remove the bowl from the skillet and set aside briefly until the mixture is only warm, not hot.\n\n3 Using a wooden spoon, stir in the almond extract. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring quickly after each one. When the batter looks shiny, thick, and well mixed, add the flour and stir until you cannot see it any longer, then beat for 40 strokes with the wooden spoon. Stir in the pecans. Spread the batter evenly in the lined pan.\n\n4 Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out just slightly moist with batter, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the brownies cool completely on a rack.  Lift up the ends of the foil or parchment paper liner, and transfer the brownies to a cutting board. Cut into 16 or 25 squares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If one is going to take the trouble to make chocolate brownies, and incur the wrath of the Fat-god for eating them, one may as well make them right. Brownies from a box? No thank you. This is my dear friend Suzanne’s recipe, which she originally got from Epicurious and modified to use almond extract in place of the vanilla (the original recipe calls for 1/2 tsp of vanilla). They are the kind of brownie that can’t make up their mind whether they would rather be cake or fudge. The almond extract gives these brownies a wonderful flavor, a perfect blend with the cocoa and pecans.\n
485	Tomatillo Salsa Verde	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Remove papery husks from tomatillos and rinse well.  \n\n2a Oven Roasting Method Cut the tomatillos in half and place cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Place under a broiler for about 5-7 minutes to lightly blacken the skin.\n\n2b Pan Roasting Method Coat the bottom of a skillet with a little vegetable oil. Heat on high heat. Place the tomatillos in the pan and sear on one side, then flip over and brown on the other side. Remove from heat.\n2c  Boiling Method Place tomatillos in a saucepan, cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove tomatillos with a slotted spoon.\n\n3 Place tomatillos, lime juice, onions, cilantro, chili peppers, sugar in a blender or food processor and pulse until all ingredients are finely chopped and mixed.  Season to taste with salt.  Cool in refrigerator.\nServe with chips or as a salsa accompaniment to Mexican dishes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Growing up we always had a choice of two kinds of salsa – a red tomato salsa which we made from scratch, and a salsa verde, or green salsa, which we got from a bottle (Victoria brand). As a kid I always thought that green salsa was made from green tomatoes, but actually it is made with a Mexican relative of a tomato, the tomatillo (pronounced “toe-mah-TEE-yo”), which looks like a little green tomato covered with a husk. Here’s a quick and easy recipe for making Salsa Verde.\n
486	Chai	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a 2-qt saucepan, add spices to 1 cup of water.  Bring to a boil; remove from heat; let steep for 5-20 minutes, depending on how strong a spice flavor you want.\n\n2 Add 4-6 cups of whole milk to the water and spices.  If you don't have whole milk, you can also use non-fat or low-fat milk, just add some cream to it, a few tablespoons.  Bring the milk and spice mixture just to a boil and remove from heat.\n\n3 Add the tea to the milk and let steep for 5 to 10 minutes to taste.  (Option at this point - reheat to a simmer and remove from heat.) You can add sugar at this point, or serve without sugar and let people put the amount of sugar in they want.  Traditionally, sugar is added before serving.\n\n4 Strain into a pot.  Serve.  Add sugar to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The first time I had chai, I was in a small rented room in the Chungking Mansion in Hong Kong (notoriously cheap accommodations). Our little cel block area probably had 4 bedrooms, and one little old Chinese lady who sat in the entryway and managed them. The morning after my arrival I was still reeling from the shock of my expectations when I booked the place (“Chungking Mansion, my that sounds quite nice”) compared to the reality of the place, when the little old lady asked me, “Chai?”, pointing to a pot on the stove. “Sure,” I replied, not knowing exactly what was coming, perhaps tea? Boy was I surprised, and in the best possible way. Chai is tea, black tea, but tea steeped in milk, flavored with wonderful spices and sweetened with sugar or honey. This wonderful chai was the best discovery in Hong Kong; I couldn’t wait to spend another night in the Mansion, just to have some more chai in the morning. That was over 15 years ago and since then chai has become much more popular here.\nThe other day my friend Suzanne served up some delicious chai and told me more of her experiences with it while in the Peace Corp in Africa. According to Suzanne, families have chai recipes the way they have curry recipes, every one a little different and each particular to a family. It can conveniently be made all in one pot, and you can use sweetened condensed milk from a can – important in the tropics. If you really want the authentic experience, drink it from a tin cup. Here is the way that Suzanne makes her chai:\n
487	Plum Cobbler	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).\n\n2 In a large bowl, combine 3/4 cup white sugar, plums, cornstarch and cinnamon.  Place the fruit mixture in a 2-quart casserole.  \n\n3 In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 2 Tablespoons of sugar, flour, baking powder and salt.  Cut the butter in with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in the milk and egg until just moistened.  \n\n4 Drop batter on fruit, or if desired, spread batter in stripes.  Bake in a 350°F oven for 35 minutes.\n\nServe with whipped cream (optional).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What to do with Santa Rosa plums? One easy and absolutely delicious possibility is plum cobbler. This was so good, we’re making it again tomorrow. (Have to do something with all these plums!) \n
488	Tuscan Scrambled Eggs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat olive oil on medium heat in a nonstick skillet.  Add the onions and cook until translucent, just starting to turn golden in color, about 6 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook over low heat until the liquid evaporates, about 40 minutes.\n\n\n\n2 Whisk the eggs in a bowl until well blended.  Season with a little salt and pepper.  Add the eggs to the tomato and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, and scraping from the bottom with a wooden spoon.  Remove from heat as soon as the eggs begin to set, but are still moist, about 3 minutes.  Turn out onto a serving plate.  Serve immediately.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I honestly don’t know if they serve scrambled eggs this way in Tuscany, but ever since we started making eggs this way, pulled from Tuscany: The Beautiful Cookbook we’ve called them “Tuscan Eggs”. They are very easy to prepare; the trick is to simmer the tomato and onion sauce for at least a half an hour before adding the eggs. Delicious with toast.\n
490	Perfect Pie Crust	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor; pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with pea size pieces of butter. Add ice water 1 Tbsp at a time, pulsing until mixture just begins to clump together. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready. If the dough doesn't hold together, add a little more water and pulse again. Note that too much water will make the crust tough.\n\n2 Remove dough from machine and place in a mound on a clean surface. If you want an extra flaky crust, shmoosh the dough mixture into the table top with the heel of the palm of your hand a few times. This will help flatten the butter into layers between the flour which will help the resulting crust be flaky. You can easily skip this step if you want. Gently shape the dough mixture into two disks. Work the dough just enough to form the disks, do not over-knead. You should be able to see little bits of butter in the dough. These small chunks of butter are what will allow the resulting crust to be flaky. Sprinkle a little flour around the disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days.\n3 Remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under the dough to keep the dough from sticking. Carefully place onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge of the pie dish.\n4 Add filling to the pie.\n5 Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently place onto the top of the filling in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking pie can escape.\n \nAll Butter Crust with Almonds\nIngredients\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling\n1/2 cup finely ground blanched almonds or almond flour\n1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 heaping teaspoon brown sugar\n6 to 8 Tbsp ice water, very cold\nFollow directions as for the All Butter Crust Pâte Brisée, but with the above ingredients. Include the ground almonds in with the flour and the salt and sugar in step 2 above.\n \nTo Pre-Bake a Pie Crust\nIf your recipe calls for a pre-baked crust, as many custard pie recipes do, follow all the steps above until you get to the point where it says to put in the filling. Note that you will need to make only a half recipe if you are only doing a bottom crust. Freeze the crust it for at least a half hour, until chilled. This is an important step in pre-baking. Otherwise the crust will slip down the sides.\n\nPreheat your oven to 350°F. When the pie crust is sufficiently chilled, line the pie crust with parchment paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil. Fill at least two-thirds full with pie weights - dry beans, rice, or stainless-steel pie weights. Bake with weights for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cool a few minutes and carefully remove pie weights. Poke small holes in the bottom of the pie crust with a fork and return to oven (without the weights) and cook for an additional 10 minutes, until the crust is golden. Cool completely before filling. You may need to tent the edges of the pie with aluminum foil when you bake your pie, to keep the edges from getting too dried out and burnt.\n \nCombination Butter and Shortening Crust\nIngredients for one double-crust 9 inch or 10 inch pie:\n2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n2 Tablespoons sugar\n3/4 cup (a stick and a half) unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/4 inch cubes\n1/2 cup of all-vegetable shortening (8 Tbsp)\n6-8 Tablespoons ice water\n1 Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor; pulse to mix. Add the butter and pulse 4 times. Add shortening in tablespoon sized chunks, and pulse 4 more times. The mixture should resemble coarse cornmeal, with butter bits no bigger than peas. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of ice water over flour mixture. Pulse a couple times. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready. If the dough doesn't hold together, keep adding water, a tablespoon at a time, pulsing once after each addition, until the mixture just begins to clump together.\n2 Remove dough from machine and place in a mound on a clean surface. Divide the dough into 2 balls and flatten each into 4 inch wide disks. Do not over-knead the dough! Dust the disks lightly with flour, wrap each in plastic, and refrigerate for at least an hour, or up to 2 days before rolling out.\n3 After the dough has chilled in the refrigerator for an hour, you can take it out to roll. If it is too stiff, you may need to let it sit for 5-10 minutes at room temperature before rolling. Sprinkle a little flour on a flat, clean work surface and on top of the disk of dough you intend to roll out. (We use a Tupperware pastry sheet that has the pie circles already marked.) Using a rolling pin, apply light pressure while rolling outwards from the center of the dough. Every once in a while you may need to gently lift under the dough (a pastry scraper works great for this) to make sure it is not sticking. You have a big enough piece of dough when you place the pie tin or pie dish upside down on the dough and the dough extends by at least 2 inches all around.\n4 When the dough has reached the right size, gently fold it in half. Lift up the dough and place it so that the folded edge is along the center line of the pie dish. Gently unfold. Do not stretch the dough.\n5a If you are only making a single crust pie, use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 inch of the lip of the dish. Tuck the overhang underneath itself along the edge of the pie dish. Use your fingers in a pinching motion, or the tines of a fork to crimple the edge of the pie crust.\n5b If you are making a double crust pie, roll out the second disk of dough. Gently place onto the top of the filling in the pie. Use a kitchen scissors to trim the overhang to an inch over. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. Finish the double crust by pressing against the edges of the pie with your finger tips or with a fork.\n6 Use a sharp knife to cut vents into the top of the pie crust, so the steam has a place to escape while the pie is cooking. Optional Before scoring, you may want to paint the top of your crust with an egg wash (this will make a nice finish).\n \nEgg Wash\nA lovely coating for a pie can be achieved with a simple egg wash.\n1 Tbsp heavy cream, half and half, or milk\n1 large egg yolk\nBeat egg yolk with cream and brush on the surface of the pie with a pastry brush.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The big dilemma for those of us who like to cook but don’t always have the time to do everything perfectly is whether to attempt to make our own pie crust or to buy a frozen store bought version. Most frozen pie tins available in supermarkets across the country bake up into something that can taste pretty industrial. Although both Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods offer some pre-rolled frozen pie dough circles that will serve in a pinch.\nIf you do choose to make your own pie crust, there are a dozen methods out there for doing so. Every cook and every cookbook seems to have their own favorite. All butter, all shortening, vegetable oil, part butter/part shortening, lard; the list goes on.\nThe following are instructions for making 1) a basic butter crust (pâte brisée) for sweet and savory pies and tarts, 2) a butter crust with ground almonds replacing some of the flour for added flavor for sweet pies such as apple pie, 3) a pre-baked pie crust needed for dishes such as quiche, 4) a combination butter and shortening crust, and 5) an egg wash finish for the pie.\nThe instructions will yield enough dough for 1 10-inch pie with a crust top, or 2 10-inch topless pies or tarts. If you are making a tart or just a pie bottom, cut all ingredients in half.\n
491	Vermont Maple Syrup Pork Chops	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 400°F.  Heat the butter or oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat.  Pat dry the chops with paper towels. Lightly salt the pork chops then brown each side in the sauté pan.  Cook just enough to brown, then remove from pan and place into a high-sided baking dish or roasting pan.  (If your pork chops are very thin and have cooked through at this point, skip the oven step and tent them loosely with aluminum foil while making the sauce.)\n\n2 Add the minced onion to the sauté pan in which you browned the pork, and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until the onion begins to brown. Add the vinegar, chili powder, pepper, maple syrup, water, and Worcestershire sauce to the pan and bring to a boil. Pour this sauce over the pork chops in the baking dish. Lower the heat to 350°F and bake uncovered for 10-15 minutes for thick (1-inch thick) chops, 5-10 minutes for thin (1/2-inch thick) chops, or until the interior of the pork reaches 145°F.\n\n3 Optional In the same sauté pan that you used to make the sauce, add a little oil and heat to medium high.  Cook the sliced onions in the pan, allowing the onions to pick up any sauce remaining in the pan.  Cook until lightly browned, while the pork chops are baking.\n\n4 Place the pork chops on a serving platter and loosely tent with foil. Pour the sauce into the saucepan you seared the chops in and whisk in 1 tablespoon flour to thicken the gravy. Salt to taste, and serve the gravy over the chops and (optional) onions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated August 2011.\nA great, simple dish of pork chops, seared and then finished in the oven with a maple syrup-vinegar-Worcestershire sauce gravy, which gives the pork a bit of a sweet and sour flavor. We’ve adapted this recipe from one we found years ago in the Boston Globe.\n
492	Apple Butter	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreparing the Fruit\n1 Cut the apples into quarters, without peeling or coring them (much of the pectin is in the cores and flavor in the peels), cut out damaged parts.\nFirst Stage of Cooking\n2 Put them into large pot, add the vinegar and water, cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cook until apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nMeasure out the purée and add the sugar and spices\n3 Ladle apple mixture into a chinois sieve (or foodmill) and using a pestle force pulp from the chinois into a large bowl below. Measure resulting puree. Add 1/2 cup of sugar for each cup of apple pulp. Stir to dissolve sugar. Add a dash of salt, and the cinnamon, ground cloves, allspice, lemon rind and juice. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.\nSecond Stage of Cooking\n4 Cook uncovered in a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir to make sure a crust is not forming at the bottom. Cook until thick and smooth (about 1 to 2 hours). A small bit spooned onto a chilled (in the freezer) plate will be thick, not runny. You can also cook the purée on low heat, stirring only occasionally, but this will take much longer as stirring encourages evaporation. (Note the wider the pan the better, as there is more surface for evaporation.)\nCanning\n5 There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.\n6 Pour into hot, sterilized jars and seal. If you plan to store the apple butter un-refrigerated, make sure to follow proper canning procedures. Before applying the lids, sterilize the lids by placing them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Wipe the rims of the jars clean before applying the lids. I use a hot water bath for 10 minutes to ensure a good seal.\nAs an alternative to stove cooking the puree you can cook uncovered in a microwave, on medium heat to simmer, for around 30 minutes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s hard to find any apple butter, let alone good apple butter in the grocery store these days. Making apple butter is a great way to preserve the fruits of an apple harvest. In contrast to what the name implies, there is no “butter” in apple butter. The name comes from its smooth and buttery texture. Apple butter is delicious on buttered toast. Although apple butter takes time to make (the sauce is slow cooked for at least an hour), the upfront part is easy. You do not have to peel or core the apples. The pectin for firming up the resulting jam resides mostly in the cores and there is a lot of flavor in the apple peels. After the first cooking, these parts get discarded as the pulp is run through a food mill.\n
495	Extra Thick Apple Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Start with the crust. In a food processor, combine flour, almonds, salt and brown sugar, pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk 1 Tablespoon at a time, pulsing until mixture solidifies into a ball. Remove dough from machine and shape into 2 discs. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.\n2 While the dough is cooling, start cook the apples. Mix 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, salt, ground ginger, and cinnamon into a large mixing bowl. Add the apples and lemon zest and toss to combine. Transfer apples to a large, thick-bottomed covered pan or Dutch oven and cook, covered, over medium heat, stirring frequently, until apples are just tender when poked with a fork, but still hold their shape - about 15 to 20 minutes (but not so long for the apples to turn into applesauce, put apples in a colander over a bowl to drain excess liquid. Drain off as much juice as possible.\n3 Preheat oven to 425°F with a baking sheet on a rack on the lowest rung of the oven.\n4 Back to the crust. While the apples are cooling and draining, remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Sprinkle some flour on top of the disk. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12 inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, use a metal spatula to check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. Add a few sprinkles of flour if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Gently fold in half. Place on to a 9-inch pie plate, lining up the fold with the center of the pan. Gently unfold and press down to line the pie dish with the dough.\n5 Add the filling to the pie. Add the apple filling to the dough-lined pie pan. Sprink on 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. Dot with butter.\n6 Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently turn over onto the top of the apples in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold dough under itself so that the edge of the fold is flush with the edge of the pan. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking pie can escape. Beat egg yolk with cream and brush on the surface of the pie with a pastry brush.\n7 Set pie on preheated baking sheet (to catch any juices that may escape from the pie while cooking). Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 375°F and cook for an additional 50 minutes, until filling bubbles in the center and crust turns golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 1 1/2 hours. Cut into wedges and serve with vanilla ice cream.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Apple season means apple pies, and my favorite are those apple pies packed with apples, not overly sweet, and with a buttery crust. The problem with baking thick apple pies is that the apples shrink as they cook, leaving a gap between the crust and the apples, which usually collapses upon cooling. The trick is to gently cook the apples first, so that they do their reducing before they go in the pie. I settled on this recipe after trying several; it draws its crust from a mile-high apple pie recipe in Oprah Magazine and its method adapted from a method for deep-dish apple pie in Cooks Illustrated.\n
517	Cheese Fondue	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Place the shredded cheese and cornstarch in a plastic freezer bag.  Seal, shake to coat the cheese with flour or cornstarch.  Set aside.\n\n2 Rub the inside of a 4-quart pot with the cut garlic, then discard.  Add the wine and lemon juice to the pot, and bring to a low simmer on medium heat. Bit by bit, slowly stir the cheese into the wine.  Stir constantly in a zig-zag pattern to prevent the cheese from seizing and balling up.  Cook just until the cheese is melted and creamy.  Do not let boil. Once the mixture is smooth, stir in kirsch, mustard and nutmeg.\n\n3 Transfer the cheese to a fondue serving pot, set over a low flame to keep warm.  If your pot is thin-bottomed, a lit candle will probably do.  If thick-bottomed, you can use a small Sterno.\n\n4 Arrange various dipping foods around the fondue pot. (A lazy Suzan works great for this.)\n\nTo eat, spear dipping foods with fondue forks or small forks. Dip to coat with the cheese, and eat.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Being a quintessential Swiss dish, cheese fondue conjures up images for me of alpine ski huts, deep snow and 20°F weather. Well, we don’t get much snow or cold weather in the California central valley, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a good fondue party. \nThe trick to a successful fondue (other than the obvious one of having wonderful people around with whom to share it) is to ensure that the cheese dipping sauce stays smooth. Cheese has a propensity to get stringy or to “seize up” into clumps, the fat separating from the proteins. Food science author Harold McGee suggests several things in his book On Food and Cooking to ensure a perfect fondue.\nWell-aged or moist grating cheeses work well in sauces. Don’t heat the cheese beyond its melting point, cheese tends to ball up at higher temps, and don’t let the cheese cool down too much before serving, as it tends to get stringier and tougher as it cools. Don’t over stir the cheese, doing so will encourage stringiness. Coating the grated cheese with a starch such as flour or corn starch will help stabilize the sauce. Also,\n\nThe combination of cheese and wine is delicious but also savvy. The wine contributes two essential ingredients for a smooth sauce: water, which keeps the casein proteins most and dilute, and tartaric acid, which pulls the cross-linking calcium off of the casein proteins and binds tightly to it, leaving them glueless and happily separate. (Alcohol has nothing to do with fondue stability.) The citric acid in lemon juice will do the same thing. If it’s not too far gone, you can sometimes rescue a tightening cheese sauce with a squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of white wine.\n\n
496	Mom’s Baked Apple Slices	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs you slice up the apples, check for their flavor.  If they don't taste good raw, believe me, they aren't going to taste good cooked. \n\nPut apple slices in a glass bowl.  Sprinkle on top the 3 Tbsp of sugar.  Add a light sprinkle of cinnamon.  Bake in microwave oven for 5 minutes on high heat.  Adjust the time for your microwave and how many apples you are doing.  Ours has a powerful high setting so 4 cups of apples only takes 5 minutes.  If you use more apples, you will probably need to cook it a little longer.  I suggest starting with 5 minutes and testing for doneness with a fork.  If it needs more cooking time, give it more.  When done, remove and mix so the sugar coats well all the apple pieces.  Add maple syrup to taste, about 1 Tbsp.\n\nDelicious with whipped cream on top, or with vanilla ice cream on the side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We have 3 apple trees on which we grow 15 varieties of apples, so we are always looking for good and easy apple recipes. My mom started cooking up apples this way for an everyday dessert a few years ago and it is what we have almost every night during apple season. We did struggle with what to call it. Mom wanted, “apple pie without the crust”, but we nixed that. “Apple pie filling” didn’t go over very well either. “Baked apple slices” is as near as we can come, even though they aren’t baked in the oven but cooked rather quickly in a microwave.\n
497	Classic Baked Acorn Squash	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n\n2 Using a strong chef's knife, and perhaps a rubber mallet to help, cut the acorn squash in half, lengthwise, from stem to end. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and stringy stuff in the center of each half. Score the insides of each half several times with a sharp knife. Place each half in a baking pan, cut side up. Add about a 1/4 inch of water to the bottom of the baking pan so that the skins don't burn and the squash doesn't get dried out.\n3 Coat the inside of each half with 1/2 a Tbsp of butter. Add a dash of salt if you are using unsalted butter. Add a Tbsp of brown sugar to the cavity of each half. Dribble on a teaspoon of maple syrup to each half.\n\n4 Bake in the oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, until the squash is very soft and the tops are browned. Do not undercook. When finished, remove from oven and let cool a little before serving. Spoon any buttery sugar sauce that has not already been absorbed by the squash over the exposed areas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The weather has finally decided to cool down around here and the first acorn squash have appeared at our local farmers market. Acorn squash are wonderfully easy to prepare – just cut them in half, scoop out the seeds, add a little brown sugar and/or maple syrup, and bake for a little over an hour. From Google Definitions,\nChoose squash that are heavy for their size and have a hard, deep-colored rind free of blemishes or moldy spots. The hard skin of a winter squash protects the flesh and allows it to be stored longer than summer squash. It does not require refrigeration and can be kept in a cool, dark place for a month or more, depending on the variety. Once the seeds are removed, winter squash can be baked, steamed or simmered. They’re a good source of iron, riboflavin and vitamins A (more than summer squash) and C.\n
498	Salmon with Tomato, Onions, and Capers	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large, wide (at least 12 inches wide) saucepan (one that comes with a cover), heat olive oil on medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Raise the heat to medium-high and add the tomatoes, thyme, lemon zest, lemon juice, capers, and jalapeño peppers.  Simmer for 10 minutes, adding a little water if needed to prevent the sauce from getting too dry.  Salt and pepper to taste. \n\n2 Add 1/3 a cup of white wine - a simple Chardonnay will work.  Add 1/4 cup of water.  Bring to a simmer.  Place the fillets in the pan on top of the sauce, skin side down, if the fillets are still in their skin.  Cover and reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook for 5-10 minutes, depending on how thick the cuts of fish are.  Poke the fish with a fork and look for doneness.  The fish should still be somewhat rare in the middle, but not raw.  Serve immediately, with tomato sauce generously applied.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every year in mid September, my friend Jim organizes a group of his friends to go salmon fishing off the coast of Marin, north of San Francisco. For the second year in a row, I didn’t a catch a fish; Jim however was luckier, and I lucky to be his friend as I got to take some gorgeous salmon home with me. Here is how we cooked it up today – poached in a tomato, onion, lemon, and caper sauce. \n
499	Dad’s Potato Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place peeled, cut potatoes in a large pot.  Cover with an inch of salted water.  Bring a pot of water to boil.  Simmer for 10-20 minutes until just fork tender.  Remove from pot.  Let cool enough to handle, but still warm. \n\n2 Put potatoes in to a large bowl.  Add the juice from the Kosher dill pickles.  Add the finely chopped pickles themselves.  Add parsley, onions, celery, scallions and, if using, the hard boiled egg, carrots, and red bell pepper.\n\n3 In a separate small bowl, mix mayonnaise with mustard.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Mix in the dressing with the potato mixture.  Again, salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated December, 2011.\nA month ago or so I made some potato salad. I love potato salad and was well pleased with this one. Then the next week my father made his version of potato salad. It was great too! The difference? Pickle juice and mustard. Also he throws in a hard boiled egg once in a while too. Note that getting the recipe out of my parents generated the usual recipe banter. Dad: “Use Russets.” Mom: “I’ve been making this recipe for years with all kinds of potatoes.” Dad: “Use Russets.” We’re using Russets in this recipe, which is why it is called, “Dad’s” potato salad.\n
500	Nectarine and Peach Cobbler	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat to 375 with rack in middle position. Score fruit by cutting an X on the bottom of each. Blanch in boiling water 10 seconds, then transfer with slotted spoon to bowl filled with cold water. Once cool enough to handle, peel off skin, starting from X and discard. If the fruit is ripe, the skin will just slide off. If not, remove the rest of the skin with a peeler. Halve and pit the fruit; cut into real thin slices.\n2 Transfer fruit to heavy saucepan and add lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly, then boil, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Remove from heat.\n3 Pour melted butter into 13x9 or 12x7 glass baking dish (if you use the smaller dish, put a cookie sheet in the rack underneath it to catch what might boil over). Whisk flour, baking powder, salt and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a bowl, then whisk in milk until combined until the consistency of pancake batter. Pour batter over butter. Do not stir. Then pour fruit over batter. Again, do not stir. Bake till cobbler is bubbling and top is golden brown, about 40-45 minutes. Cool in pan until warm.\nServe topped with whipped cream.\nServes 8-10.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It is getting to the end of the peach and nectarine season here. I picked the last 4 ripe yellow nectarines from our tree today. But what to do with them? Inspiration came from a recent food blogger picnic where we all enjoyed the most wonderful peach cobbler prepared by Food Musings Catherine Nash, who got her recipe from Gourmet. It came out just as I remembered it, though we all agreed here that the recipe itself was a little too sweet for our taste. So in the following recipe I have reduced the sugar from 1 2/3 cups to 1 1/4 cups. Many similar recipes on the net require even less sugar – 3/4 cups to 1 cup, and use either fresh or canned peaches. The beauty of this recipe is that it is so easy – pouring batter on top of melted butter and then adding the fruit.\n
501	Oxtail Pâté (Pate)	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Carefully pick through and discard the fat and bones from the oxtails. Place the meat in a food processor. \n\n2 Heat 2 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add the chopped onions.  Cook until translucent and lightly browned, about 5-10 minutes.  Add the cooked onions to the oxtail meat in the food processor.  Add 4 Tbsp more of butter, the orange juice, peppercorns, bouillon or broth, cloves and salt. Pulse until the mixture is finely minced, but not completely smooth.\n\n3 Press the pâté into a crock or mold of some sort.  The pâté will keep several days in the fridge, covered.  \n\nBring to room temperature for serving, and serve with crusty bread or crackers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe accompanies the recipe for Beef Bouillon Soup from Oxtails and is from a recipe in the December 1993 issue of Gourmet. Once making the bouillon, you can use the cooked oxtail meat to make a delicious oxtail pâté. I love pâtés of all kinds (see Pâté Maison), but they usually have liver in them, which many people don’t like. Oxtail pâté, however, has no liver, and is just made with the rich, flavorful meat of oxtails. If you’ve gone through the trouble to make the oxtail bouillon, making this pâté is a cinch, since you are starting with already cooked oxtails. It takes only a few minutes to prepare with a food processor. \n
502	Beef Bouillon Soup from Oxtails	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 450°F.  Pat dry the oxtails with paper towels and put them in a roasting pan.  Sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper.  Add the carrots, onions, and zest.  Roast in the middle rack, turning the oxtails as the are browned.  Once browned, remove from oven and place the oxtails and vegetables into a large stockpot. \n\n2 Place the roasting pan on the stovetop on medium high heat.  Add the wine to the pan to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits.  Add the liquid to the stockpot with the oxtails.  Add the cranberries, mushrooms, celery, thyme, bay leaf, cloves, and peppercorns. Bring the liquid to a boil, skimming whatever foam rises to the surface.  Reduce the heat and simmer gently, uncovered, for 3 hours.\n\n3 Ladle the mixture through a sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels into a large bowl.  Reserve the oxtails for another use, such as oxtail pate.  Discard the remaining solids.  The bouillon can be made 3 days in advance and kept chilled.  Discard excess fat (leave enough to cover soup when chilled).  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Many recipes call for beef stock (e.g. French onion soup), but good beef stock is hard to come by, with beef prices these days, expensive to make. Beef oxtails make a wonderful stock and sometimes you can get them (try Costco) at a reasonable price. If you’ve never cooked oxtails before, they do indeed come from the tail of a steer, and they make the most divinely flavorful stew. Their bones are also filled with marrow, perfect for making bouillon. It makes a delicious soup all on its own. You can also use it as a base for French onion soup or other beef-based soups.\n \nWe found this recipe in an old issue of Gourmet magazine. It accompanied an oxtail pâté which you make from the strained oxtails from this recipe. \n
503	Chipotle Bean Tostadas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the beans by sautéing onions in oil until softened in a large, thick-bottomed skillet. Add ground cumin and cook an additional 30 seconds. Add the beans, a teaspoon of salt, and a cup of water. Use a potato masher to mash the beans into the pan, until the consistency of (somewhat lumpy) mashed potatoes. Cook for a few minutes on medium hight heat until water is absorbed. Stir in the Chipotle Tabasco sauce and season to taste with more salt if needed. Remove to a warm burner out of the way, cover.\n2 To prepare the tortillas, heat the oven to 200°F. Line a baking pan with paper towels and place next to the stove. Heat 5 Tbsp of oil in a small skillet on medium high heat, until the bubbles form immediately when you insert the edge of a tortilla in it. Using tongs, place a tortilla in the hot oil and let cook until golden brown on both sides, about 30 seconds per side. You can use a metal spatula to flatten down the tortilla while cooking.\nUse tongs to lift the cooked tortilla out of the pan, allowing the excess oil to drip off of it, back into the pan. Place the cooked tortilla on the paper towels to absorb more of the oil. Sprinkle a little salt onto each warm tortilla. Do each tortilla one at a time this way. As you fill up a baking pan, put the pan in the oven to keep the tortillas warm.\nAdd more oil as needed. Carefully monitor the oil temperature. Don't let it get too hot, or the tortillas will burn, or too cool - they won't fry up crisp enough.\n3 To serve, arrange the cheese, cilantro and tomatoes in separate small bowls. Put beans into a serving dish. Bring out the tortillas by batches, keeping the rest warm in the oven. Let people spread beans on to their tortillas and add sprinkle on the cheese, cilantro and tomatoes for each tostada. Optional additions are sliced lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa (though with the chipotle, you probably don't need any more heat).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tostadas are toasted or fried corn tortillas, topped with a layer of refried beans and other things such as cheese, lettuce, and salsa. Growing up, my mother made tostadas or tacos for us at least once a month, the main difference being that tostadas are flat, crispy, and layered with beans, and tacos are folded and usually without beans. This food is kid heaven – messy, choose your own topping, and incredibly tasty. This month we found a recipe in Fine Cooking for Smokey Refried Bean Tostadas. This recipe called for a slightly different approach to the beans – they suggested adding cumin and Chipotle Tabasco sauce. The chipotle added such a terrific smokey chile flavor to the beans, no salsa was needed on the tostadas. I think they are the best refried beans we’ve ever had. We make our beans from scratch, so I don’t know how it would taste with canned beans, but the smokey flavor of the chipotle is wonderful.\n\nTo cook the tortillas, we love to use grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil is a very light oil with a high flash or smoke point, which means that you can get it pretty hot before it starts to burn, making it easier to cook with. It is also very healthy, high in many essential fatty acids. It is not widely available, but beginning to get more available in grocery stores. We get ours at the local Raley’s grocery store (California chain).\n
504	Persimmon Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n1  Cream butter, brown sugar, vanilla and eggs in a large bowl.  Add persimmon puree, stirring until blended. \n\n2  Stir together dry ingredients in a separate bowl.  Add dry ingredients to persimmon mixture a third at a time, stirring just until flour is incorporated. Stir in nuts.  \n\n3  Lay out plastic wrap on a large smooth surface.  Place the cookie dough on the plastic wrap and form into a long cylindrical log, wrapping the dough completely with the plastic wrap.  Place in freezer.  Chill at least a couple of hours, until frozen or almost frozen.   \n\n4 Preheat oven to 375°F.  When dough is fairly solid, unwrap from plastic wrap and slice with a sharp knife, 1/4" thick rounds.  Lay out cookie dough rounds on stick-free cookie sheets, leaving at least an inch between the cookies.  Bake for 10-12 minutes or until cookies spring back when lightly touched in center.  Let cool on baking racks before frosting.\n\n5 When cookies have cooled, lay out over a sheet of wax paper.  Sift confectioner's sugar and then whisk with 2 Tbsp of milk until smooth.  Add 1 Tbsp of persimmon puree and 1 tsp of grated orange peel and mix until smooth.  Dip spoon into glaze mixture and dribble over cookies.  Let harden and serve.\n\nMakes about 2 dozen cookies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Persimmon trees are often planted as decorative trees; around November, the trees begin to lose their leaves and what remains are bright orange fruit hanging from the trees like Christmas ornaments. I received some hachiya persimmons from a neighbor’s tree recently with which to make cookies. First they needed to ripen, the process of which we speeded up by placing them in a brown paper bag. When they were finally ripe (it took a few weeks), I found a grocery store recipe for persimmon cookies. The problem was that the cookies were missing that special something; they were too plain on their own. So, I improvised with a glaze that uses some of the persimmon pulp for color and orange zest for added tang. The result was terrific. The orange glaze complements and accents the persimmon and cinnamon of the cookies.\n \n\nPersimmons come in two varieties – Fuyu and Hachiya – with very different properties. Fuyu persimmons are short and squat, looking a little like tomatoes; they are meant to be peeled, sliced, and eaten like apples. Hachiya (those pictured are unripe Hachiya) are larger than the Fuyu and somewhat acorn shaped. They need to ripen completely. Unripe hachiyas are extremely astringent and will make your mouth pucker if you try to eat them. When the Hachiya persimmon behaves like a seriously overripe tomato (completely soft to the touch all around) and its insides are a slurry, that’s when they can be opened, and the sweet pulp spooned out and eaten. One makes baked goods like these persimmon cookies with the pulp from Hachiya persimmons.\n
522	Sugared Pecans	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 300°F.\n\n2 Put sugar, cinnamon, salt, ground cloves, and ground nutmeg in a plastic bag, shake to mix.\n\n3 Put egg, water, and vanilla in a bowl.  Beat until slightly foamy, add pecans and coat well.  Lift pecans out of bowl with a slotted spoon and put into the bag of sugar and spices.  Shake pecans in bag making sure they are well coated.  \n\n4 Bake 30 minutes on a baking pan lined with silpat or lightly greased aluminum foil.  15 minutes into the baking, stir up the pecans with a fork.  Let cool completely before serving.\n\nMakes about 2 cups.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Sugared pecans must be one of the easiest candies to make. No worries about melting sugar, humidity, or candy thermometers. Just coat the pecans with an egg white solution, and then again with some sugar and spices, pop them in the oven and make for half an hour. The only problem? They are so addictive. A friend of mine made me promise not to bring any over to her; the last batch that came her way never made it to her kids! Muchas gracias to Heidi H. for the recipe.\n
505	Tuna Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large (6 qt) pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Add a tablespoon of salt.  Return to a boil. Add noodles.  Cook uncovered on high heat on a rolling boil.  Just before pasta is al dente, (firm but cooked through, earliest cooking time minus 2 minutes), add the chopped broccoli to the pasta and cook for 2 more minutes.  Drain in a colander and set aside.\n\n2 While the pasta is cooking, dry sauté the mushrooms in a frying pan on medium high heat (no need to add butter or oil, mushrooms will cook in their own juice).  When mushrooms have given up their moisture (about 10 minutes), remove from heat and set aside.\n\n3 After the pasta is done and is draining in a colander, heat a large oven-proof pan on medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of butter.  Add the onions and cook them until translucent.  Add the pasta and broccoli mixture back into the pot; stir in the mushrooms.  Stir in the tuna, can of cream of mushroom soup,  grated cheese, milk and cream.  Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4 Spread crushed potato chips over the top of the mixture and cook for 20 minutes at 400°F in the oven, until the topping has browned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father and I have been reminiscing lately about my mom’s tuna casserole, the one she used to make in the 60s, with cream of mushroom soup, broccoli, lots of cheese, and a crushed potato chip topping. Mom has only the vaguest recollection of a tuna casserole (“I think it had broccoli in it.”) In fact, today she said she had no memory of it at all. Did she really make it? Or are dad and I remembering something instead from a school cafeteria? In any case, I attempted to reproduce it for today’s lunch, in honor of the weekend and long forgotten family traditions. Entering our pantry for the first time in 20 years was a can of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom Soup (really must use this one, no other will do.) Also, I used Kettle potato chips – very good quality. The verdict? Yep, it’s definitely tuna casserole – filling, cheesy, crunchy topping, not too tuna-y. I haven’t had this in years, decades probably. The visiting picky eater kids (okay, not that picky, thank God) had three servings. This is a good sign.\n
506	Turkey Chili	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large, 8-quart, thick-bottom pot, cook the onion and green pepper over medium high heat, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, for a minute or two more.  Add a bit more olive oil if needed.\n\n2 Add tomatoes, tomato paste, stock. beans, oregano, salt, pepper, and cooked turkey meat.  Bring mixture to a simmer and reduce heat to low.  Simmer, uncovered, for an hour.\n\n3  Salt to taste.  Add 1 to 3 teaspoons of sugar to take the edge of the acidity of the tomatoes if desired.\n\nThe chili may be made in advance and chilled for 2 days, or frozen for 2 months.\n\nServe with shredded cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, and or sour cream.  Serve alone, over rice, or with corn bread.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	In preparation for Thanksgiving, and in anticipation of turkey leftovers, we’ve been experimenting with various turkey dishes that use cooked turkey. This recipe is an easy one for turkey chili using turkey leftovers. (My mom makes great chili beans if you want a chili that starts with ground turkey). Note that this turkey chili recipe makes a lot of chili. We had so much leftover after making this batch that we used a bunch of it as the sauce and filling for enchiladas (which, by the way, is a terrific way to use up extra chili).\n
507	Perfect Mashed Potatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put potatoes into a saucepan. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add water until potatoes are covered. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered, 15-20 minutes, or until done - a fork can easily be poked through them.\n2 Warm cream and melt butter, together, either in microwave or in a pan on the stove. Drain water from potatoes. Put hot potatoes into a bowl. Add cream and melted butter. Use potato masher to mash potatoes until well mashed. Use a strong spoon to beat further, adding milk to achieve the consistency you desire. (Do not over-beat or your potatoes will get gluey.) Salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There has been much written on the best way to make mashed potatoes – how long you cook them, with peel or without, reserving some of the cooking liquid, etc. etc. I have discovered that the real trick to creamy, buttery, heavenly potatoes is to use Yukon Gold potatoes instead of Russets. That’s really all there is to it (along with butter, cream, salt and pepper). Just start with the type of potato that tastes better and mashes up better. According to the Food Network,\nStarchy potatoes, like russets, have high starch and low water. Starchy potatoes are great for baking and French fries, and good as mashed potatoes. When cooked in water, they disintegrate; when cooked by dry heat, they become crumbly and fluffy.\nAll-purpose, or chef’s potatoes, like Yukon Golds, have medium starch and medium water. All-purpose potatoes are great in stews, soups, mashed potatoes, or for roasting. When cooked, they are at once moist and fluffy: they keep most of their shape in soups and don’t dry out when baked.\n\nHere’s our recipe for perfect Yukon Gold mashed potatoes:\n
508	Brussels Sprouts	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Remove any ragged or old-looking outer leaves on the brussels sprouts and discard. Parboil the brussels sprouts (or steam them) for 3 minutes or until just tender. They should be almost cooked all the way through (split one in half to test). Strain the hot water and place the sprouts in a bowl of ice water, this will keep their color bright green. Cut the sprouts into halves.\n2 Heat 2-3 Tbsp of butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add 2-3 Tbsp more of butter and the brussels sprouts halves. Increase the heat to medium high and cook for several more minutes. Salt and pepper to taste, while the brussels sprouts are cooking. Do not overcook! Overcooked brussels sprouts are bitter and are the main reason why some people don't like them.\n3 Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and half of the toasted almonds. Add salt and pepper to taste. Place in serving dish and garnish with the rest of the toasted almonds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I never used to like brussels sprouts, until one day I had them when they weren’t over-cooked. Still just a little bit crunchy, they had a wonderfully nutty flavor. Who knew brussels sprouts could taste so good? Now I love them, especially with brown rice and butter.\n
509	Apple Cranberry Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a food processor, combine flour, almonds, salt and brown sugar, pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with pea size pieces of butter. Add water 1 Tablespoon at a time, pulsing until mixture just begins to clump together. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready, if not, add a little more ice water and pulse again.\nRemove dough from machine and place on a clean surface. Carefully shape into 2 discs. Do not over-knead the dough! You should still be able to see little bits of butter in the dough. These bits of butter are what will allow the result crust to be flaky. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.\n2 Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375°F.\n3 Combine cranberries, sugar, flour and allspice in large bowl. Mix in apples, then add brandy and vanilla extract.\n4 Remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Sprinkle some flour on top of the disk. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12 inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, use a metal spatula to check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. Add a few sprinkles of flour if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Gently fold in half. Place on to a 9-inch pie plate, lining up the fold with the center of the pan. Gently unfold and press down to line the pie dish with the dough.\n5 Spoon in apple filling, mounding slightly in center.\n6 Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently turn over onto the top of the apples in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold dough under itself so that the edge of the fold is flush with the edge of the pan. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Stir yolk and cream in small bowl to blend. Brush over top of pie. Cut slits in top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake pie until apples are tender and crust is golden, anywhere from 50 minutes to an hour 5 minutes, depending on the type of apples you are using. Transfer to rack; let stand 1 hour. Serve pie warm or at room temperature.\nServes 8.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every year for the past 6 or 7 years, my father has served this apple cranberry pie at some point over Thanksgiving weekend. He found the recipe years ago in Bon Appétit magazine (Oct, 1998). This year we’ve modified the recipe to include an even better butter crust. This really is one of the best, if not the best, apple pie I’ve ever had.\n
544	Bolognese Meat Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Make the soffritto. Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold.\n\n2 Add the beef, pork, sausage to the soffritto, and increase the heat to high; cook until browned. Sprinkle with the clove, cinnamon, and pepper.\n3 Stir in tomatoes, bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.\n\n4 Add milk and season with sea salt. Then turn down the heat and simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce gets too dry and starts sticking to the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.\nCan easily freeze for future use.\nServe with pasta.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This Bolognese sauce is a family recipe of one of our readers and is used in our Lasagna Bolognese recipe. Slow cooked for at least a couple of hours, the sauce is deep, rich, flavorful and worth the extra effort.\n
510	Cheesy Skillet Cornbread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place a 9 or 10-inch cast iron pan in the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\n2 In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar, garlic powder, and salt.  Add remaining ingredients, and stir until just combined.  \n\n3 Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven (remember the handle is hot!). Place a teaspoon of bacon fat in the bottom of the hot pan and swirl it around until it is all melted and coating the bottom of the pan.  Pour the batter from the mixing bowl into the pan.  Remember to put a pot holder over the hot handle of the pan and return it to the oven.\n\n4 Bake for 40 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from oven and let the cornbread cool in the pan.  Remember that the handle is hot and will stay hot for quite some time.  I recommend rubbing an ice cube over the handle to cool it down, just to avoid someone burning their hand if they attempt to move the pan before it has cooled down enough.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated Oct 12, 2012\nThis cornbread is packed with cheese, onions, and whole corn, and flavored with bacon drippings. Need I say more? This recipe is inspired by a favorite of my friend Lynn from her The Southern Living Cookbook. Lynn likes to make hers with Shoepeg white corn. We used regular yellow corn and it turned out terrific. Perfect with chili.\nThe recipe calls for the corn bread to be baked in the oven in a cast iron skillet. We serve the corn bread at the table directly from the skillet, the benefit being that because the cast iron holds its heat so well, the corn bread stays warm throughout the entire meal.\n
511	Chicken Apple Arugula Goat Cheese Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat stick-free frying pan to medium heat.  Add a tablespoon of olive oil and lightly sauté the shallot slices until translucent.  Remove from pan.  Add another tablespoon of olive oil and cook the chicken breast pieces, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through - 5 to 10 minutes.  Sprinkle some salt on the chicken while you are cooking it.  Remove from pan and chill.\n\n2 When chicken has cooled, toss together in a serving bowl the shallots, chicken, sliced green apple, arugula, walnuts and goat cheese.  Dress with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServes four.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Arugula on its own is so peppery it can almost be too much. However, partnered with either walnuts, goat cheese, or in this case both, mellows the tanginess of the arugula. A perfect, light, luncheon salad.\n
512	Giant Ginger Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt; set aside.\n\n2 In a large mixing bowl beat together butter with the 2 cups granulated sugar. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in eggs and molasses. Beat in the flour mixture, using a wooden spoon.  \n\n3 Shape dough into 2-inch balls using 1/4 cup dough. Roll balls in the 3/4 cup coarse or granulated sugar. Place about 2-1/2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.\n\n4 Bake in a 350°F oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until cookies are light brown and puffed. Cool on cookie sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool. Store in a tightly covered container at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Suzanne’s daughter Audrey loves to cook. When Audrey and I were first getting to know each other she made me a batch of her favorite giant ginger cookies. (She thinks she got the recipe from an old Sunset magazine, but I haven’t been able to find the actual source.) The first time Audrey made these cookies for me she was about 10 years old. Now she’s almost 15 and still making these fabulous cookies. Here’s what she told me about them when she was 10:\n“I wanted to make these cookies because my mom always made these cookies when I was little and they tasted soooo good. The first two times I made them they didn’t turn out so good (forgot to add the baking soda). The third time’s the charm though. This time they turned out perfectly. I made them all by myself, without any help from mom.”\n
513	Golden Beet and Pomegranate Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook the beets - either boil them for 45 minutes or roast them at 375°F for an hour. Let cool. Peel and dice into 1/2 inch cubes.\n2 In a medium skillet over high heat, bring diced beets, onion, vinegar, broth, liqueur, sugar, and orange peel to a boil, stirring often, until liquid is reduced to 2 Tbsp, about 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.\n3 Stir pomegranate seeds into the beet mixture and salt to taste. Serve on top of salad greens on individual plates. Sprinkle with feta cheese.\nServes 4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Now here’s a salad for the season. Our neighbor Pat stopped me yesterday and handed me a recipe for a beet and pomegranate salad that she had pulled from an old issue of Sunset magazine. Perfect timing, as the pomegranates on our tree are bursting with ripeness. The original recipe called for using regular beets, but golden beets are much prettier mixed in with the pom seeds. Here’s my version of the recipe:\n
514	Gluten-free Pumpkin Cupcakes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCupcakes\n\n1 Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.  In a mixer, beat the butter, molasses, brown sugar, and honey together until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. (Start on low speed and increase to high speed to get the mixture light and fluffy.)\n\n2 Add the eggs, one by one, mixing well after each addition.  Add the vanilla and pumpkin purée. Beat until well mixed.\n\n3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients—the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and spices.  Add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to the pumpkin batter, in three additions, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.\n\n4 Use a wooden spoon to mix in the pecans and raisins.\n\n5 Arrange paper cupcake holders in a muffin tin.  Portion out the batter into the cupcake paper cups, filling them close to the top of the cups.  Bake about 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Remove from oven to a rack.  Let cool completely before frosting.\n\nFrosting\n\n6 In an electric mixer, beat together the cream cheese and butter until smooth.  Add maple syrup and confectioners' sugar and mix to combine.  Once cupcakes have cooled, apply the frosting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Many people are sensitive, some extremely so, to gluten – a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Shauna of Gluten-free Girl has a whole blog devoted to gluten-free cooking (with recipes and gorgeous photography, by the way). As someone who had to give up wheat for 10 years, I can tell you that it isn’t easy, living without pizza, bread, and pasta. We still don’t eat much wheat around here. Many of the pasta recipes we make with rice or spelt pasta. The hard thing is finding good gluten-free baked goods. So many of them really taste awful, the consistency of sawdust. Fortunately, the wheat/gluten alternative flours appear to be improving.\n \n\nI found a bag of this Wheat and Gluten Free Baking Flour from Red Mill in the health food section of our local grocery store and decided to try it out on a batch of pumpkin cupcakes. I had low expectations for this experiment, and thought it would help to dress up the recipe a bit with nuts and raisins, molasses and honey, anything actually, to help the cupcakes be more edible. The result surprised all of us. The cupcakes were delicious! Really good. Sort of like carrot cake, a good carrot cake.\nNote that Red Mill’s Gluten-Free Flour contains the following ingredients: garbanzo flour, potato starch, tapioca flour, sweet white sorghum flour, fava flour.\n
515	Quick Bolognese Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat butter in a large sauté pan on medium high.  Add the finely chopped onion, celery, and carrots. Sprinkle a little salt over everything. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine, cook for another minute or so.\n\n2  Add the ground beef to the onions, celery, and carrots, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon as you add it to the pan. Again, sprinkle a little salt over everything.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 15 minutes.\n\n3 Stir in the wine (if using), scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let this boil down by half. Stir in the tomatoes. Slowly stir in the milk. Increase the heat to bring the mixture to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer.  Simmer uncovered about 20 minutes. Add a little water if the sauce ever begins to dry out. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A traditional Bolognese sauce requires hours of simmering and careful attention. But sometimes we don’t have hours and we just want a sauce that’s maybe not as spectacular as it could be, but still quite good enough. This simplified Bolognese sauce takes about an hour to make, instead of several, but still delivers on wonderful flavor. Instead of starting the sauce with pancetta, which would be traditional, we use butter, which melts quickly and provides plenty of flavor. A key ingredient in the sauce is milk, whole milk. It’s standard for a Bolognese sauce and important for the flavor and creaminess of the sauce.\n
516	Tapioca Pudding	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine tapioca, milk, and salt in 1 1/2 quart pan on medium high heat.  Stir until boiling.  Simmer 5 minutes, uncovered at the lowest possible heat, adding sugar gradually.  \n\n2 Beat eggs in a separate bowl.  Mix in some of the hot tapioca very slowly to equalize the temperature of the two mixtures (to avoid curdling).  \n\n3 Return eggs to pan with tapioca.  Slowly bring mixture barely to a boil, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat and stir several minutes at a low simmer, stirring constantly until you get a nice thick pudding consistency.  Cool 15 minutes.  Add vanilla.  Serve either warm or chilled.\n\nNote:  If you want to make a more light and fluffy, but still rich, tapioca pudding, separate the eggs.  Use the egg yolks to stir in first to the pan with the tapioca.  Once the pudding has become nice and thick, beat the egg whites in a separate bowl to soft peaks.  Remove the pan of tapioca pudding from the stove, fold in the beaten egg whites into the pudding.\n\nServes 4-6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of my favorite desserts growing up was tapioca pudding. You don’t see it that much anymore. Kids get pre-made over-sugared puddings from the grocery store. My parents don’t make it that often as it requires too much (for them) careful stirring while the tapioca cooks. And you won’t find tapioca on any low-carb diets as it is pure starch, from the same plant as cassava. Yet tapioca pudding is one of those comfort foods that conjures up happy childhood memories. It’s actually really easy to make.\n
539	Shaved Fennel Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGently toss all of the ingredients together.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When I announced I was making a fennel Parmesan salad, my father remarked something to the effect, “That sounds like something for ‘ladies who lunch’.” It does, doesn’t it? The idea came from a recipe in the South Beach Diet Cookbook. I never would have thought to put Parmesan alongside fennel, but it’s actually quite good. The cheese perfectly complements the slight licorice hint of the fennel. Thyme and parsley provide the accents along with a simple olive oil and lemon dressing.\n
518	White Chili	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Combine beans, chicken broth, garlic and half the onions in a large soup pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until beans are very soft, 3 hours or more.  Add additional water (or watered-down broth), if necessary.  \n\n2 In a skillet, sauté remaining onions in oil until tender.  Add chilies and seasonings and mix thoroughly.  Add to bean mixture.  Add chicken and continue to simmer 1 hour.  Check seasoning, add jalapeno or serrano to level of desired hotness.\n\n3 Serve topped with grated cheese.  Garnish with cilantro, chopped fresh tomato, salsa, chopped scallions, and/or guacamole.  Serve with fresh warmed flour tortillas or tortilla chips.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Steve-Anna, who has been tempting me with tales of her white chili for years, finally sent me the recipe. It originally comes from the Beyond Parsley, by the Junior League of Kansas City, MO. Both she and I have modified the base recipe. For the version pictured above, I used canelli beans instead of Great Northern which cook up faster than the 3 hours called for in the recipe. Also I’ve added some jalapeno pepper for more heat. The base recipe is tasty, but like most white chilis, a little mild. Steve-Anna’s notes for her modifications and a photo of her chili are at the end of the recipe.\n
519	Roast Beef	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Start with the roast at room temperature (remove from refrigerator  1 hour before cooking - keep it wrapped).  Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\n2 With a sharp knife make 8 small incisions around the roast.  Place a sliver of garlic into each incision.  Take a tablespoon or so of olive oil and spread all around the roast.  Sprinkle around the roast with salt and pepper.  Place the roast directly on an oven rack, fatty side up, with a drip pan on a rack beneath the roasting rack.  This arrangement creates convection in the oven so that you do not need to turn the roast.  The roast is placed fat side up so that as the fat melts it will bathe the entire roast in its juices.\n\n\n\n3 Brown the roast at 375°F (190°C) for half an hour.  Lower the heat to 225°F (107°C).  The roast should take somewhere from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours additionally to cook.  The shape of the roast will affect the cooking time, by the way.  So if your roast is on the long and narrow side, versus a more round shape, it may take less time to cook.  So keep an eye on it.  When the roast just starts to drip its juices and it is brown on the outside, check the temperature with a meat thermometer.  Pull the roast from the oven when the inside temperature of the roast is 135° to 140°F (57°C to 60°C).  Let the roast rest for at least 15 minutes, tented in aluminum foil to keep warm, before carving to serve.\n\n\n\nTo make the gravy:\nRemove the dripping pan from the oven and place on the stove top at medium heat.  Note that if you are pulling the roast out early, for rare or a medium rare level of doneness, you may not have a lot of drippings.  Hopefully you will have some.  If not, you may want to leave the roast in a little longer at even lower heat, 175°F, to ease some more drippings out of it.  Add some water, red wine, or beef stock to the drippings to deglaze (loosen the drippings from the pan).  Dissolve a tablespoon of cornstarch in a little water and add to the drip pan.  Stir quickly while the gravy thickens to avoid lumping.  You can add a little butter if there is not a lot of fat in the drippings.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Mom adds some fresh thyme too if she has some.  (See also How to Make Gravy.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mom knows a lot about cooking beef. She knows all of the cuts and what to do with them. This must have something to do with growing up at a time where people went to their local butchers for meat instead of a supermarket. We typically use a rump roast when making roast beef. You can also use a round roast or a sirloin tip with these instructions. This slow roasting method at low heat is good for tougher cuts of beef; the lower heat prevents any gristle from getting too tough. This method should not be used with choice or prime grades of beef, or the more tender cuts, as slow cooking more delicate cuts will make them mushy.\nRoast beef made this way is easy, relatively inexpensive, and you get great leftovers for roast beef sandwiches.\n
520	Hot Mulled Cider	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Pour apple cider into a 3-quart saucepan, cover, turn the heat on medium-high. While cider is heating up, take a vegetable peeler and peel away a couple thick strips of peel from the orange. Press about half of the cloves into the peeled part of the orange. (You can also just quarter the orange and add the slices and cloves separately. I just like seeing the orange bob up and down.) Place orange, orange peel strips, the remaining cloves, and the rest of the ingredients into the sauce pan with the cider. Keep covered and heat the mulled cider mixture to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes on low heat.\n2 Use a fine mesh sieve to strain the hot mulled cider away from the orange, cloves, and other spices. If you want, you can add a touch of bourbon, brandy, or rum to spike it up a bit. Serve hot. Add a cinnamon stick to each cup if desired.\nMakes 8 cups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tis the season to be jolly, and to drink hot mulled cider. This delicious hot apple cider drink is a specialty of New England. Spiced with a clove-studded orange, nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon, hot mulled cider is the perfect drink to serve during the holidays.\n
521	Cranberry Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Wash and pick over cranberries. In a saucepan bring to a boil water and sugar, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add cranberries, return to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer for 10 minutes or until cranberries burst.\n2 At this point you can add all number of optional ingredients. We typically mix in a half a cup of roughly chopped pecans with or without a few strips of orange zest. You can add a cup of raisins or currants. You can add up to a pint of fresh or frozen blueberries for added sweetness. Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice can be added too.\n3 Remove from heat. Cool completely at room temperature and then chill in refrigerator. Cranberry sauce will thicken as it cools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father loves cranberry sauce. I think he enjoys turkey during the holiday season just as an excuse to eat more cranberry sauce. He stocks up on fresh cranberries when they are in season in the fall, and freezes them. When he runs out around May he starts buying canned cranberry sauce. He’ll go through a whole can all on his own, usually in stealth mode lest we catch him and give him grief about it. I honestly prefer raw cranberry relish over the cooked sauce. But this is a family recipe site and dad deserves his favorites up here too.\n\nThe good thing about cranberry sauce is that once you have the base down, you can dress it up a bit.\n
814	Grilled Spicy Citrus Ribs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the brine.  Combine the juices and water and measure in a measuring cup.  You should have exactly 2 1/2 cups liquid.  If you have less, add enough water so that you have 2 1/2 cups of  liquid, if you have more, discard the excess.  The correct ratio of liquid to salt is important for the brine to work properly.  Place liquids in a medium sized bowl, add other brine ingredients - salt, thyme, and red pepper flakes.  Stir for half a minute until the salt has completely dissolved.\n\n\n\n2 Prepare the ribs.  If you want, remove the thin membrane that lines the concave side of each rib rack.  This will make it easier for the brine and spices to penetrate as well as easier to cut and eat when the ribs are done.  Insert a dull knife edge between the membrane and ribs to loosen.  Grip the loosened membrane and pull away to remove.  Cut the racks in half.  Put in a plastic ziplock freezer bag.  Add the brine to the bag.  Squeeze the excess air out of the bag and seal the bag.  Massage the brine into the ribs. Place the bag of brine and ribs into a bowl (in case there is leakage) and place into the refrigerator.   Refrigerate in the brine for 3-6 hours. Note that brining too long can over-saturate the meat with the brine.  So stick within the 3-6 hour time frame.\n\n3 Prepare bourbon glaze.  Heat bourbon with sugar, peppers, and salt.  Whisk in butter until melted.  Set aside or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.  Warm before using.  You can also prepare while the meat is cooking in the next step.\n\n\n\n4 Prepare the grill for indirect heat.  On a gas grill, heat the grill to medium heat 300-325°F with the middle burners turned off (if a 3 or 4 burner grill) or one burner turned off (if a 2 burner grill).  For a kettle grill with charcoal, use 3-4 pounds of briquets pushed to one side of the grill.  An aluminum disposable drip pan set next to the briquets, underneath where the meat will be, will help keep your grill easier to clean.  (I forgot this time, notice no drip pan in the photo, and now the grill's a mess.)\n\n\n\n5  Remove the ribs from the brining bag.  Pat dry the ribs with paper towels.   Brush grill grates with olive oil or canola oil.  Place the ribs on the side of the grill away from the source of heat, either gas or briquets.  Cover the grill.  If you are using a gas grill, lower the burners so that you are maintaining a temperature of about 300°F-325°F in the grill.  If you are charcoal grilling, cover the grill so that the air vent on the kettle top is directly over the ribs.  This way smoke from the charcoal will waft its way over the ribs on the way out of the grill.  Adjust the vents so that the air flow is much reduced.  Reducing the size of the air vents is a way to help control the temperature in the grill and keep it low.  Fire lives off of oxygen, so if you reduce the oxygen, you reduce the amount of burning and heat.  If you close the vents too much, the charcoals will put out too little heat, so the trick is to maintain a balance - enough air flow to keep the coals alive, but not too much or the grill will run too hot and your ribs will overcook.  Try to maintain a temperature of about 300°F-325°F in the grill.  If you are using a charcoal grill that doesn't have a built-in thermometer, you can put a meat thermometer through the grill air vent to take a reading of the temp.\n\n\n\n6 After 20-25 minutes of cooking, use tongs to flip the rib racks over.  If you are charcoal grilling, shift the ends of the ribs as well so that the end that was facing the coals now faces the edge of the grill.  Check for doneness using a meat thermometer after 15-20 more minutes.  They are done and ready to pull off at 155°F, but you want to get to them 10 minutes or so before they are done to apply the glaze.  So at about 145°F start applying the spicy bourbon glaze.  Brush the ribs with the glaze syrup, turning and basting the ribs until the syrup has been used up.  When an instant read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the ribs reads 155°F, the ribs are ready to take off the grill.\n\nNote that depending on the amount of heat in the grill and the size of your ribs, the ribs could be done in as little as 45 minutes or as long as 1 1/2 hours.  If the grill temperature stays more at about 350°F, then the ribs will be done faster.  It's hard to maintain a charcoal grill lower than 350°F, though ideally for these ribs you do want the temp lower, closer to 300°F.  Also note again that baby backs are smaller than St. Louis style and will cook faster.\n\n\n\n7 Remove the ribs to a large serving platter and cut into 1 or 2-rib sections.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	As any Southerner will tell you, the proper way to cook ribs is to barbecue them “low and slow” in a smoker built for that purpose. But not everyone has a smoker, and not all of us have the time or patience to watch over cooking ribs for several hours. The following is a recipe for spareribs that have been soaked in a spicy citrus brine and then grilled over indirect heat for about an hour. Brining is a useful technique in this case as it’s easy to overcook pork ribs on a grill, but because the brine plumps up the meat with extra moisture, the ribs are still tender and don’t get as dried out, even if you do end up overcooking them a little. This recipe is adapted from Andrew Schloss’ and David Joachim’s Mastering the Grill: The Owner’s Manual for Outdoor Cooking.\n. \n
523	Candied Walnuts	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Use middle rack in oven.  Lay walnuts out on a baking sheet in a single layer.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Test for doneness.  If not quite toasted enough, toast for 1 or 2 more minutes.  Be careful not to burn.  Remove from oven and let cool in pan on a rack.\n\n2 Pour sugar into a medium saucepan with a thick bottom.  Have walnuts nearby, ready to quickly add to the pan at the right time.  Cook sugar on medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon as soon as the sugar begins to melt.  Keep stirring until all the sugar has melted and the color is a medium amber.  As soon as sugar is melted and the color is a medium amber, add the walnuts to the pan, quickly stirring and coating each piece with the sugar mixture.\n\n3 As soon as the walnuts are coated with the sugar mixture, spread them out on a rimmed baking sheet, lined either with a Silpat non-stick mat, or parchment paper.  Use two forks to separate the walnuts from each other, working very quickly.  Sprinkle the nuts with the salt.  Let cool completely.\n\nMakes 1 1/2 cups.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Walnuts. Sugar. That’s pretty much all you need to make candied walnuts. A dash of salt helps too. These are very easy to make. The trick is to work very fast once the sugar starts melting, because once it gets on the walnuts it cools quickly and the walnuts will stick together. You have 30 seconds or so to separate them before they are forever bonded by glassy, cooked sugar. The other trick is to not burn the walnuts when you toast them. (Yes, we’ve done that before…)\n
524	Collard Greens	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Use a large skillet with a tight fitting cover.  Melt bacon fat and heat olive oil on medium heat.  Sauté onion until transparent, a couple of mintues. Add garlic and and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n\n2 Mix in the greens, sesame oil, chili pepper flakes, salt, and sugar.  Cover and cook until tender, 8-15 minutes. (Note that young collard greens will cook up relatively quickly. Older greens may take upwards of 45 minutes to tenderize.)\n\nIf you want, serve with barbecue sauce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My brother Eddie was over for dinner a while ago one fortuitous night when we happened to be having collard greens. I say fortuitous because Ed introduced us to a wonderful new way to serve these healthful, somewhat bitter greens – with barbecue sauce. Huh? Barbecue sauce? Ed explained that whenever he had collard greens it was with barbecued ribs, and the sauce from the ribs would make its way over to the collard greens, making them taste oh so good. Well, that was enough incentive to try it, and I must agree, collard greens are excellent served with a little BBQ sauce. They are also pretty good on their own with onions and garlic. Here’s my dad’s recipe.\n
525	Refried Beans	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse the beans in water and remove any small stones, pieces of dirt, or bad beans.\n2 Cook the beans in water.Regular method Put beans into a pot and cover beans with at least 3 inches of water - about 3 quarts for 2 1/2 cups of dry beans. Bring to a boil and then lower heat to simmer, covered, for about 2 1/2 hours. The cooking time will vary depending on the batch of beans you have. The beans are done when they are soft and the skin is just beginning to break open.Pressure Cooker method Put beans into a 4 quart pressure cooker with a 15 lb weight. Fill up the pressure cooker with water, up to the line that indicates the capacity for the pot. Cook for 30-35 minutes - until the beans are soft and the skins are barely breaking open. Allow the pressure cooker to cool completely before opening. If there is resistance when attempting to open the cooker, do not open it, allow it to cool further. Follow the directions for your brand of pressure cooker. (See safety tips on using pressure cookers.)\nStrain the beans from the cooking water.\n3 Add the onions and lard/fat/oil to a wide, sturdy (not with a flimsy stick-free lining) frying pan on medium high heat. Cook onions until translucent. (Note the onions are optional, you can skip them if you want.) Add the strained beans and about a 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Using a potato masher, mash the beans in the pan, while you are cooking them, until they are a rough purée. Add more water if necessary to keep the fried beans from getting too dried out. Add salt to taste. Add a few slices of cheddar cheese, or some (1/2 cup) grated cheddar cheese if you want. When beans are heated through (and optional cheese melted) the beans are ready to serve.\nNote that many recipes call for soaking the beans overnight and discarding the soaking liquid. We don't. We discard the cooking liquid and just add some water back into the frying pan when we are frying the beans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Frijoles Refritos\nPinto beans, prepared Mexican style, are such a staple in our house a week rarely goes by without my mother making up a batch. Although beans have a relatively long shelf life, the older they are the longer you’ll have to cook them to get them to soften. Find a source that supplies fresh beans. If you have some that have been sitting around for more than a year, they’ll be tough and not as good, you’ll need to cook them longer.\n“Refried” is actually a misnomer. In this instance, refritos means “well fried”, not “refried”, though you can certainly reheat the beans as you go through a batch. Before frying them though you’ll need to cook them, in water, to soften them. There are basically two ways to initially cook the beans – with a pressure cooker and without. Since we make beans so often, we use a pressure cooker. It greatly cuts down on the cooking time. Here are directions for both methods.\n
526	Peanut Butter Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Beat the butter until creamy, 2 minutes.  Add the sugars, beat for 2 more minutes.  Mix in the peanut butter and egg.  Mix together the dry ingredients - flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  Stir the dry ingredients into the sugar butter mixture.\n\n2 Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate at least 3 hours.\n\n\n\n3 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Shape dough into 1 1/4 inch balls. Place about 3 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten in crisscross pattern with a fork. Bake until light brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for a minute; transfer to rack to cool completely.\n\nFor chewier cookies, bake at 300°F for 15 minutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I learned something new today: peanut butter cookies are my mother’s favorite cookie. I had no idea. Dad, however, won’t eat them. Go figure. Peanut butter cookies are one of my favorite cookies; they remind me of school. They were always available in the cafeteria. With all the stress on nut allergies in schools these days, I doubt they are being served as often as when I was a kid. Easy to make for yourself though, with this simple recipe.\n
527	Pork Medallions with Mustard-Caper Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If the tenderloin cuts are not an even thickness, use a rolling pin or mallet to flatten them to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n\n2 Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tenderloin medallions to the pan and sauté them until browned and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the medallions from the pan to a plate while you make the sauce.\n\n3 Add the shallots to the pan and cook for a minute, stirring. Add the cream and chicken broth. Increase heat  to a boil and boil until the sauce has thickened a bit, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Stir in the mustard and capers. Return the pork to the pan and simmer until the pork has reheated.\n\nSeason to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Dad clipped this recipe from Bon Appetit several years ago and finally got around to making it this evening. It was excellent, and very easy to prepare. The mustard, capers, shallots, broth, and cream make a wonderful sauce for the pork medallions. We recommend serving it with a creamy polenta.\n
543	White Bean and Ham Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Fill a pot large enough to hold the beans with water and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, add the beans and soak the beans for about 2 hours. Drain the water.\n2 Meanwhile, put the ham hocks or shanks in a large pot and cover with 2 quarts of water. Add the herbes de Provence or Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer and simmer for about an hour. Add the chopped vegetables and beans. Cook for another hour, until the vegetables are soft and the ham meat easily pulls away from the bone. Pull the meat off the bone and discard the bones.\n3 Add several drops of Tabasco to taste. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with a pinch of chopped fresh parsley.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We’ve had some wonderfully cold, rainy, winter storms here lately in Northern California. This soup is the perfect hardy accompaniment to a cold winter day. Note, this soup is the kind that is much better the next day, as the flavors from the beans, ham, and vegetables have had time to blend.\n
528	Homemade Ginger Ale	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan. Add ginger. Reduce heat to medium low and let ginger sit in the simmering water for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Strain liquid through a fine mesh strainer. Discard ginger pieces.\n2 In a separate saucepan, make the Simple Syrup by dissolving 1 cup granulated sugar into 1 cup of boiling water. Set aside.\n3 Make individual (tall) glasses of ginger ale by mixing 1/2 cup of ginger water with 1/3 cup of Simple Syrup and 1/2 cup of club soda. Add a few drops of fresh lime juice and a lime wedge to each glass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A few weeks ago, I got together with a few other food bloggers for lunch at a terrific diner – Canteen in San Francisco. Lunch was fabulous, truly. Make your way there if you get a chance. One menu item that struck my fancy was homemade ginger ale, which they made fresh to order. After lunch, on my way out the door, I stopped the waitress to ask how they made it. She gave me a general idea, which I have attempted to recreate in the steps shown here. The Canteen version includes a little touch of ground clove and cardamon if I recall correctly. I didn’t add those spices, without them the ginger ale still turned out just great. It’s quite easy to make. You may need to adjust the proportions depending on how intense or sweet you want your drink.\n
529	Tuna Macaroni Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a saucepan, add 1 cup of elbow macaroni to 1 quart of boiling water with an added teaspoon of salt. Simmer either covered or uncovered for about 10 minutes until the macaroni is just a little more cooked than al dente. When ready, remove from heat, drain and rinse with cold water.\n2 While the macaroni is cooking, assemble the other ingredients. In a large bowl mix the green onion, bell peppers, parsley, tuna, celery and lemon. Add the cooked and drained macaroni. Fold in the iceberg lettuce and mayonnaise until well mixed. Add the paprika. Add fresh ground pepper to taste.\nEat up. This salad does not make good leftovers as the lettuce will eventually get soggy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Almost every other Friday growing up my mother would serve the family this tuna macaroni salad. With six kids she loved this standard; it was easy to make, filling, relatively inexpensive, and best, we all gobbled it up.\n
530	Almond Roca	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo not attempt to make this on a humid or rainy day.  Do not double the recipe, make one batch at a time.\n\n1 Melt butter with sugar, syrup and water in a pan (such as a large non-stick frying pan) on medium to medium-high temperature.  Stir continuously with a wooden spoon.  When butter is melted, add the almonds.  \n\n2 When mixture comes to a rolling boil, set your timer for a minimum of 10 minutes and keep stirring (no more than 15 minutes).  The mixture will thicken and turn darker in color.  The almonds will roast.  Keep stirring and cooking until you hear it crackle.  If you don't cook it long enough it will not harden, so keep stirring and listen for the crackling sound.\n\nElise's note:  I have found it very hard to distinguish between the boiling sound and the crackling sound in this recipe.  A better guideline for me is by color.  When the mixture turns a warm amber color, at about 11 or 12 minutes into the boiling, that's the time to pour it out.  Wait too long and it will burn.\n\nIf you try to make this, please read all the comments listed below.  It's actually trickier than one would think.\n\n3 When the mixture crackles, pour the mixture out onto a large cookie sheet and spread it as thin as possible with a fork.  While it is still hot, break up the chocolate into chunks and distribute it over the almond mixture and let it melt.  Spread it evenly on the top.\n\n4 Let it cool to room temperature.  When cool you can lift the whole thing off the pan and break into small pieces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I have a severe weak spot for almond roca during the holiday season. I can resist fruitcake, all manner of Christmas cookies, puddings and mince pies. But when it comes to almond roca, will power abandons me. (That will be an extra hundred situps for the next two weeks, please.) My mother’s friend Myke brought over a delicious batch a week ago, which lasted, um, an hour? A phone call with a rave review prompted her to bring us a second batch along with the recipe. Thanks Myke!\n
531	Minestrone Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Soak beans overnight in cold water. Drain beans, rinse, and place them in a large saucepan or stockpot. Add salt pork or pancetta and 6 cups of broth. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook gently for about 1 hour.\n2 Heat oil in a separate large stockpot. Add chopped vegetables (onion, celery, carrot, garlic, parsley) and sauté gently 5 to 8 minutes or until lightly browned. Add remaining vegetables and tomatoes. Add remaining 5 cups broth. Simmer for 40 to 50 minutes or until vegetables are tender.\n3 Remove salt pork or pancetta from beans. Dice finely. Transfer half of the beans to a food processor or a blender and blend into a paste. Add mashed beans to the vegetables. Add remaining whole beans, broth, and diced pork to vegetables.\n4 Simmer 5 minutes longer. Season soup with salt and pepper. Serve with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	According to the Wikipedia, minestrone is an Italian soup made with fresh seasonal vegetables, often with the addition of pasta or rice. Common ingredients include beans, onions, celery, carrots, stock, and tomatoes. There is no set recipe for minestrone, since it is usually made out of whatever vegetables are in season. It can be vegetarian, contain meat, or contain a meat-based soup base (such as chicken stock). We’ve had this minestrone recipe sitting around for years and finally got around to making it this weekend. (Don’t know the source.) It was perfect, actually, for the rainy and cold January weather we’ve been having.\n
532	Cardamom Citrus Fruit Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Peel the fruit. Cut away the membranes of the individual segments with a sharp knife. Collect the peeled segments in a bowl.\n2 Drain off any excess juice from the fruit into a small saucepan. Add the lime juice, honey, and cardamom to the saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 10 minutes and then remove from heat and let cool to room temp. Pour over fruit mixture and gently fold in so that all the fruit is coated. Let stand for 15 minutes or chill until ready to serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The leaves are all down, apples, pomegranates, and persimmons all picked, days mostly overcast and dreary, save for neighborhood citrus trees with their orange and yellow orbs dotting the landscape with vivid color. Citrus trees love winter in California and our lemon, grapefruit and orange trees are heavy with fruit. Here’s a cheerful fruit salad we found in a local grocery store circular made with colorful citrus. The cardamom provides a lovely accent to the honey-sweetened citrus segments.\n
659	White Bean and Vegetable Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, thyme, and garlic. Sauté 5 minutes. Add green cabbage, tomatoes, celery, and carrots. Sauté 10 minutes.\n2 Add beans, 5 cups of stock, potatoes, and basil. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for one hour.\n3 Add red cabbage and zucchini. Add salt. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes longer. Stir in cheese. Sprinkle in a a dash of Tabasco hot sauce if you want to give the soup a little zip.\nServe with ground pepper and bread.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Is it that time of year yet for hearty soups? Maybe, maybe not. In any case, this one is a family favorite, combining a potpourri of colorful vegetables with the creamy texture of white beans.\n
533	Crab Dip	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine mayonnaise, sour cream, shallots, dill, lemon zest, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl.  Fold in the crab meat.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Chill for 2 hours or overnight.  Serve with crackers or carrots and celery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Winter is fresh crab season here in Northern California. When our local Whole Foods gets in a shipment, we’re first in line for the biggest (anything greater than 2 lbs) fresh, cooked crabs, already cleaned and broken. Dad calls it “nature’s fast food”. We’ve been known to go through a couple 2 pounders just for lunch. Note that as with all seafood, the crab’s freshness is imperative. I had to take one back to WF a few weeks ago, because it just wasn’t edible. My bad, I forgot to check. Although your fish monger should be checking before handing it over to you, you really do need to inspect it before paying for it and taking it home. The best way to test is to smell. If it smells too fishy, not good. What to do with leftover crab meat when your eye is hungrier than your stomach? Mix it into a fresh crab dip, refrigerate it overnight and eat it the next day. If you are no where near a place that sells good, fresh crab, you can of course use canned crab. Trader Joe’s has a good product. I’ve also mixed this dip up with pasta for a lovely crab pasta salad. Yum!\n
534	Moroccan Meat Loaf	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Combine the lamb and beef in a large bowl.  Set aside.\n\n2 Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and ginger and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.  Add the salt, paprika, cumin, curry powder, cayenne, cinnamon, and pepper.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes to release the flavors.  Remove from heat and let cool for 10-15 minutes.\n\n3 Stir the vegetables into the ground meat.  Mix in the bread crumbs, eggs, cilantro, and mint.  Transfer to a 1 1/2 quart loaf pan and set in a baking pan.  Pour water into the baking pan to reach halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.\n\n4 Bake the meat loaf for 1 1/2 hours, or until firm and cooked through.  Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.  Unmold onto a plate and slice.   Serve with optional Pomegranate BBQ sauce, ketchup, or just the drippings from the meatloaf itself.  Very good served with rice pilaf.\n\nServes 6-8.\n\nPomegranate BBQ Sauce\n\n1 1/2 cups ketchup\n1/4 yellow onion, minced\n1 Tbsp pomegranate molasses\n1/2 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, minced\n1 1/2 teaspoons of adobo sauce\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n\nCombine ingredients in a small sauce pan.  Bring to simmer on low heat and cook for 5 minutes just to let the flavors blend.  Remove from heat and let cool to room temp before serving.  Makes 1 1/2 cups.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The good folks at Niman Ranch recently sent me a few lamb recipes to try from their new cookbook, the Niman Ranch Cookbook. Being huge meat loaf fans, we were immediately drawn to the Moroccan Meat Loaf recipe from Chef Monica Pope, of T’Afia in Houston, Texas. If you like lamb, you will love this Moroccan meat loaf. If you don’t like lamb, I’m willing to bet this meat loaf will convert you. It is superb – spicy, with hints of cilantro and mint. The recipe calls for a pomegranate barbecue sauce to accompany the meat loaf. We made the sauce, which is excellent, but honestly, the next time we make this we’ll skip the sauce. It’s just unnecessary. Its own spiciness almost competes with the flavors of the meatloaf. I’ve included the recipe below, but you really don’t need it. Plain ketchup will do, if you have to have ketchup with your meatloaf, but just the drippings themselves are sufficient and delicious.\n \nThe original recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon of saffron threads to go along with the other spices. I don’t like saffron (everyone has their preferences when it comes to food, and I have mine), so we kept it out. It is not in the following recipe listed, but feel free to put it back in there if you want to follow the recipe as its author intended.\n
535	Kale with Seaweed, Sesame and Ginger	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse the seaweed in water and let soak, covered in water for 5-7 minutes. Drain seaweed and place in a large bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of dark sesame oil and the minced ginger.\n2 Prepare kale by soaking in water to loosen any dirt, rinsing thoroughly. Chop cross-wise into 1-inch by 2-inch pieces.\n3 In a large covered skillet, uncover and heat 2 teaspoons of dark sesame oil on medium heat. Add garlic and gently sauté for one minute, until fragrant. Add the seaweed and ginger, gently cook for 1 minute. Remove seaweed/ginger/garlic from pan back to the bowl and set aside.\n4 Heat 1 Tbsp sesame oil in the skillet. Add the chopped kale. Add 3 Tbsp of Braggs. Gently mix in the pan to coat the kale with the oil and Bragg. Cover; lower heat to low; let cook for 5-10 minutes or until kale is wilted - soft enough to eat easily, but not so soft as to be mushy. Remove cover and let cook a minute more to evaporate any excess moisture. Remove from heat. Mix in the kale with the seaweed ginger mixture. Add more sesame oil and Braggs to taste. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Living for a while in Japan does strange things to your food preferences. Instead of thinking, “eating seaweed? PHEW!” one gets a warm glow and a faraway look in one’s eyes thinking, “Eating seaweed? Ahhh. Yummm. Which kind do I want? Some sautéed hijiki? Crumpled nori with sesame and shoyu over rice? How about some silky wakame soup?” Many moons ago I saw some kale seaweed salad at the deli counter in Whole Foods in San Francisco and excitedly gave it a try. It was wonderful – the kale, ginger, sesame, seaweed and seasoning worked so well together. A week ago I saw the kale seaweed salad again at Whole Foods, this time in the Sacramento store and bought some. Not telling my father what was in it, other than kale, I got him to try some. “That’s great! Make some!” was his response, not caring one whit after I told him all that was in it. If my 75 year old, midwestern, meat-and-potatoes father can gobble up this dish, anyone can.\n\nA few of points about this recipe. First, what to call it. The Whole Foods version is labeled a salad, and the kale is barely wilted. I prefer the kale a little more cooked, but then it is no longer a salad, it’s more like a side dish. So, take your pick. Second, the recipe requires a seasoning with the unappetizing name of Bragg Liquid Aminos. This is a soy sauce substitute. It is completely natural, not fermented, and contains no wheat. It can be found at almost any health food store and Whole Foods. Bragg really is delicious and after discovering it years ago I use it regularly to season veggies. If you don’t have access to Bragg you can substitute soy sauce, but cut the amount by half to start. Finally, I have no idea how Whole Foods actually makes their version. This recipe I made up myself based on the ingredients that were listed with the Whole Foods salad.\n
536	Shrimp with Orange Beurre Blanc	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Peel and de-vein the shrimp. Work with the shrimp one at a time, leaving the rest in a bowl of ice water. Holding on to the body of the shrimp, use your fingers to pull off head if it is still attached, and then the legs. Starting with the head end, gently peel back the shell. Use your fingernails or a knife to cut into the base shell segment. Remove the shrimp from its shell entirely. Place shrimp down flat on a cutting board and use a small sharp knife to make a shallow cut down the back of the shrimp. You may see a dark, vein-like intestinal tract running through the meat. Use your fingers, or the sharp tip of a knife to remove. As you complete each shrimp, put into a bowl of ice water to keep cool. Set aside while you prepare the sauce.\n2 Zest half of one orange (about 2 teaspoons) and juice the two oranges (about 3/4 cup). Put the juice, zest, wine and shallots in a sauce pan on medium high heat. Cook until it is syrupy and almost gone.\n3 On low heat, whisk in the butter continuously and vigorously, 1 tablespoon at a time. Butter is the only emulsifier for this sauce, and if you slowly add it, continuously stirring, the sauce will achieve a silky smooth texture. Do not let the sauce boil. Salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm while you continue with the shrimp.\n4 Heat a skillet on medium high heat. Drain the shrimp and coat with olive oil. When the pan is hot, add the shrimp and sprinkle on some salt and pepper. Cook the shrimp about 45 seconds on each side. Add some more olive oil if necessary to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. Do not overcook or the shrimp will be tough and rubbery.\nDrizzle Beurre Blanc sauce over shrimp, or serve in a separate small container for dipping. Excellent accompanied by brown rice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	At a recent cooking class at Scott’s Seafood (Folsom, CA), Chef David Lamonica set us to work preparing shrimp with orange beurre blanc (a French butter and shallot sauce). Chef David says the best shrimp to get are fresh, Gulf of Mexico White shrimp, still in the shell. Gulf white shrimp are firm and sweet. For this particular dish I used Gulf of Mexico Pink shrimp, which are pink even when they are not yet cooked. The are also sweet, but a little more delicate than the Gulf white. By the way, if you are processing a lot of shrimp, the shells can be saved and used to make bisque or stock.\nWhen choosing shrimp, they should be firm and smell sweet. If you see any yellowing at all, pass on them.\n
537	Baked Lingcod with Lemon-Garlic Butter Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrepare the Sauce\n1 Put the first six sauce ingredients (clam juice, sherry, whole milk, garlic, shallots, bay leaf) in a pot and bring to a boil. Boil it down by half.\n2 In a separate saucepan (1-qt minimum) prepare the roux. Heat one tablespoon of butter in the saucepan on medium heat until it is foamy. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (tan, but not brown).\n3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate. When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up. Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.\n4 Turn the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Add some more clam stock or water if the sauce is too thick. Add the chopped parsley right before you serve.\nPrepare the Fish\n1 Arrange an oven rack so that when the fish is on a baking pan in the oven it will be 4 to 5 inches from the heat. Preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\n2 Rinse the fish in cold water, cut into serving pieces if necessary. Remove any bones with fish-bone tweezers or (spotless clean) pliers. Lay the fish flat in a aluminum foil lined baking pan. Rub some olive oil over both sides of the pieces, enough to coat. Sprinkle both sides with a few shakes of salt and pepper. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until just done. To test, use the tip of a knife to gently cut into the thickest part of the fillet. The fish is done when the fish has just turned from translucent to opaque at the center. Once you pull the fish out of the oven it will continue to cook for a few minutes.\n3 Serve the fish with the sauce poured on top. Rice, crusty bread and a simple salad are good accompaniments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever seen a lingcod? They are almost primeval looking – huge, gaping mouths with sharp teeth. As with any fish, the most important factor for how good it tastes is its freshness. I picked up this fillet at Whole Foods (they usually have a good selection of fresh fish) where they told me that the ling cod had just come in that morning. With the lemon-garlic butter sauce it was divine.\n
853	Waldorf Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a medium sized bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise (or yogurt) and the lemon juice.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper.  Mix in the apple, celery, grapes, and walnuts.  Serve on a bed of fresh lettuce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	According to the  American Century Cookbook, the first Waldorf Salad was created in New York City in 1893, by Oscar Tschirky, the maître d’hôtel of the Waldorf Astoria. The original recipe consisted only of diced red-skinned apples, celery, and mayonnaise. Chopped walnuts were added later to this now American classic. Some prefer their Waldorf salad made with yogurt, instead of mayo. Having had this salad both ways, I fall firmly in the mayonnaise camp. But feel free to substitute yogurt for the mayo if that’s your druthers.\n
538	Pork Stuffed Cabbage Rolls	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse the sauerkraut in cold water. Squeeze out excess moisture and set aside.\n\n2 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 Tbsp of salt for every 2 quarts of water). Add the whole green cabbage to the boiling water. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the cabbage. Remove the cabbage from the water and let drain until it is cool enough to handle. Pull off as many large, unbroken leaves as you can and lay them on paper towels dry. If the inner leaves haven't cooked enough to bend easily, return them to the simmering water to cook a little longer.\n3 Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onions and sauté them until translucent and beginning to color. Add the garlic and cook half a minute longer. Remove from heat.\n\n4 In a large bowl, place the ground pork, cooked rice, beaten eggs, paprika, marjoram, the cooked onions and garlic, salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Mix with your clean hands or a wooden spoon until just combined.\n\n5 Working one at a time, place a couple tablespoons of the pork stuffing in the center of a blanched cabbage leaf. Start at the thick end of the leaf and fold the sides of the cabbage over the stuffing. Then roll up the whole cabbage leaf into a tight bundle. Repeat with the remaining leaves until you have used up all of your stuffing.\n\n6 Place the rinsed and drained sauerkraut in an even layer on the bottom of a 5 or 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, such as a Dutch oven. Place the cabbage rolls on top of the sauerkraut. Pour the diluted tomato purée over the cabbage rolls. Heat on high to bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook the cabbage rolls on a low simmer for one hour.\n\n7 Remove the stuffed cabbage rolls from the pot and place on warm dish. Slowly stir the sour cream into the sauerkraut. Bring to a simmer and let cook for about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to lift the creamy sauerkraut sauce onto a serving platter. Arrange the stuffed cabbage rolls on top of the sauerkraut and spoon some sauce over them as well. Serve remaining sauce on the side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever had stuffed cabbage rolls with sauerkraut? It’s a classic Hungarian dish. Lightly cooked large cabbage leaves are stuffed with a mixture of paprika-spiced ground pork and pork sausage, and then rolled up into little bundles. They’re cooked over tomato-infused sauerkraut and then served with a sour-cream sauerkraut sauce. So good! Like tamales, they take some time to prepare, but the result? Fabulous.\n
540	Seared Ahi Tuna	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix the marinade ingredients together and coat the tuna steaks with the marinade, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least an hour.\n2 Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high to high heat. When the pan is hot, remove the tuna steaks from the marinade and sear them for a minute to a minute and a half on each side ( even a little longer if you want the tuna less rare than pictured.)\n3 Remove from pan and slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. Sprinkle with a few green onion slices.\nCan serve plain, with white rice, or over lettuce or thinly sliced cabbage or fennel. Shown served over sliced fennel salad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	After completing graduate school in the late 80s, I spent a year studying martial arts at Kyoto University in Japan. The school cafeteria served many things that one would never encounter in the states (natto spaghetti for example), but one thing they did serve that I couldn’t get enough of was seared ahi tuna, prepared fresh to order. It was usually served with white rice, a little shoyu, some radish sprouts, a few slivers of nori, and some toasted sesame seeds. One ample serving may have cost as much as 200 yen (~$2) but I think it was probably less. Seeing a recipe for seared ahi in the South Beach Diet Cookbook got me thinking again of this delicious fish, and I found some gorgeous steaks at Whole Foods. The South Beach recipe calls for the steaks to be seared with peppercorns. I was looking for a more Asian twist, so I made up my own marinade with tamari, sesame oil and ginger.\n\nAhi tuna is also known as yellowfin tuna. To make seared ahi, you need to start with very fresh, sushi-grade ahi, as you will only be lightly searing the outside, leaving the inside raw. Not even rare, but raw. The freshness and the quality of the fish make a huge difference with this dish, so don’t even attempt it with a lower grade of fish.\n
541	Low Carb Cranberry Cooler	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStir the stevia into the cranberry juice. Add the club soda.\nMakes one cup.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Let me just say right up front, that in general I do not believe in diet-induced substitutes for the real thing. In other words, I use butter, not margarine, and sugar, not splenda. If I want to lose weight I eat less and avoid desserts. That said, once in a while it is nice to have a cool, sweet drink, without all the sugar and calories. Cranberry juice in particular needs a lot of sweetener to make it palatable. Have you ever tasted pure, unsweetened cranberry juice? It is terrifically tart. That’s why supermarkets carry more cranberry “cocktail” than the unsweetened juice. Yet pure cranberry juice is very good for you, especially if you are a woman. My doctor once explained to me that cranberries have a natural antiseptic that protect women from UTIs. She also explained that the juice with added sugar isn’t nearly as effective.\n\nThis cranberry cooler uses the herb stevia as its sweetener. Stevia is a South American herb that has been used for hundreds of years as a sweetener. Since the 70s, Japan has used stevia extensively for sweetening food products. It’s available in many forms – the dried herb, a liquid extract, and a powder. You can find stevia at Whole Foods and most health food stores in the herbal supplements section. Stevia has zero carbs. This little recipe calls for 1 part pure cranberry juice to 3 parts soda water. An 8-oz glass of the cooler would have a total of 4 grams of carbs (for those of you that count these things). The taste? Refreshing and satisfying, but honestly, not quite as good as sugar. Probably very similar to if you had used splenda in place of sugar. That said, the carb count of 1 glass of the stevia sweetened cooler is 4 grams versus a typical glass of cranberry juice cocktail at 34 grams.\n
542	Lemon-Garlic Butter Sauce for Seafood	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Reduce first six ingredients (clam juice, sherry, whole milk, garlic, shallots, bay leaf) by half in a small saucepan, cooking on medium to medium-high heat.\n2 In a separate saucepan (1-qt minimum) prepare the roux. Heat one tablespoon of butter in the saucepan on medium heat until it is foamy. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (tan, but not browned).\n3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate. When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up. Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.\n4 Lower the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Add some more clam stock or water if the sauce is too thick.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A few weeks ago I spent a morning with Chef David Lamonica of Scott’s Seafood in Folsom, California, learning all about preparing seafood and sauces that work well with seafood. Of everything we prepared that morning, simple pan fried haddock with this lemon-garlic butter sauce was the most delectable.\n
551	Orange Beurre Blanc Sauce for Seafood	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Zest half of one orange (about 2 teaspoons) and juice the two oranges (about 3/4 cup).  Put the juice, zest, wine and shallots in a sauce pan on medium high heat.  Cook until it is syrupy and almost gone.\n\n2 On low heat, whisk in the butter continuously and vigorously, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Butter is the only emulsifier for this sauce, and if you slowly add it, continuously stirring, the sauce will achieve a silky smooth texture.  Do not let the sauce boil.\n\n3 Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Beurre Blanc is a French sauce (“white butter”) based on a reduction of shallots and an acid such as vinegar, citrus juice, or wine, mixed in with cold butter. Its creamy tanginess works well with mild fish such as trout, shad, or haddock. It may also be served with any shellfish including lobster, crab, and scallops. This recipe comes from a cooking class I took at Scott’s Seafood in Folsom, California, presented by Chef David Lamonica.\n
545	Golden Beets and Brussels Sprouts	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 The beets take the longest to cook so start them first. Either boil them in water in a small saucepan for 45 minutes (or how ever long it takes to get them tender), or wrap them in foil and roast them in the oven at 350°F for an hour fifteen minutes or until done. Roasting will give you better flavor, but takes longer and uses a lot more energy (unless you are already cooking something in the oven). When done, set the beets aside to cool for 10 minutes, then peel and chop them into 1 x 1/2 inch chunks.\n2 While beets are cooking toast your almond slivers if you are starting with raw almonds. Just heat a skillet to medium high heat and put in the almonds. Stir frequently with a spatula. When the almonds begin to brown, remove from pan into a small bowl. Let cool, set aside.\n3 Also while the beets are cooking, prepare the brussels sprouts. Bring 1 1/2 quarts of salted water (2 teaspoons salt) in a medium saucepan to a boil. Add the brussels sprouts to the water and blanch them for 2-3 minutes. They should be almost all the way cooked through. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Set aside.\n4 In a medium sized skillet heat 1 Tbsp olive oil on medium heat. Add the shallot slices and cook until translucent, a few minutes. Add another tablespoon of olive oil and raise the heat to medium high. Add the sprouts and beets to the pan, along with the thyme and mix well. Salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute more, stirring. Remove from heat and serve. Can serve warm or at room temperature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here’s a recipe for those of us who love both beets and brussels sprouts. (Isn’t it pretty?) I love beets in practically anything, but if you mix red beets with other foods, those foods will turn red as well. Golden beets keep their vibrant orange color without staining their neighbors, making them welcome companions for our brussels sprouts. A little thyme, some shallots and olive oil are all you need to bring the dish together.\n
546	Chipotle Citrus Marinated Pork Tenderloin	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Trim the tenderloins of any excess fat and silver skin. Set in a small nonreactive baking dish. Combine the orange juice, lemon juice, garlic, shallots and chilies in a small bowl and stir well. Pour over the tenderloins and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature.\n2 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n\n3 Heat the olive oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the tenderloins from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Wipe the tenderloins dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. Add to the skillet and cook, turning as needed, for 4 to 5 minutes, until evenly browned. Transfer to the oven and roast for 10 to 12 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 140-145°F. Remove skillet from oven and transfer the tenderloins to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Remember that the skillet handle is still hot after you put the skillet on the stove top. Use oven mitts or cool off the handle with ice.\n\n5 Pour the marinade into the skillet and add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until reduced and thickened. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.\n6 Cut tenderloins across the grain into thin slices and arrange on a platter. Drizzle sauce over top and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We picked this recipe up years ago in the Sacramento Bee, from an article about Bill Niman (formerly of Niman Ranch). They got the recipe from Gary Fuller of Laurier Cafe and Wine in Houston, Texas. The recipe cooks up quickly and is simply delicious.\n
547	Steak Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a couple teaspoons of cooking oil in a cast iron pan on high heat. Pat the steaks dry. Sprinkle with a little salt. Sear the steaks in the pan on both sides, just until nicely browned. Remove from pan to a cutting board. Let rest for a few minutes before cutting. Slice thin slices, against the grain of the meat.\n2 Toss together the lettuce greens, arugula, bell pepper, and scallions. Arrange on individual plates. Sprinkle on chopped walnuts. Sprinkle with goat cheese. Lay on top several slices of chilled sliced steak. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds or sliced kumquats if using.\n3 Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, and a dash of salt and pepper. Drizzle on salad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Steak salad is such a great way to enjoy steak. You can even easily put it together with steak leftovers. At a minimum it is simply thin slices of steak over salad greens with your preferred salad dressing. I tend to spiff mine up a bit with whatever we might have on hand – walnuts, goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, kumquats, etc., depending on what’s in season. Arugula is a particularly good complement to steak, though the pepperiness of the arugula can at times be a little too much if not mixed in with some other salad greens.\n
548	Chinese Chicken Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat both oils over high heat in a large saute pan for 1 minute, then add the red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Sprinkle chicken strips with a little salt and add them to the pan. Stir-fry the chicken over high heat until cooked through, 3-6 minutes depending on how hot your burner gets. Drain and set aside to cool.\n2 In a small bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients. Adjust to taste. In a large bowl, toss the chicken and salad ingredients together. Just before serving, toss with dressin and top with the chow mein noodles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This Chinese chicken salad is a colorful and tasty way to use up some leftover chicken and makes for a light lunch. I experimented with few different dressings and ultimately settled on this one which I think is just the right balance of soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil. Do you have a favorite Chinese chicken salad dressing? Please let us know about it in the comments.\n
549	Steamed Broccoli	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cut the crowns away from the large stems of the broccoli. Break the crown up into bite-sized florets. Rinse the broccoli florets thoroughly. Peel and discard the thick outer skin of the stems. Slice the stems or cut them into quarters lengthwise.\n2 Place 3/4 to 1 inch of water in a saucepan with a steamer and bring to a boil. (Note that is you don't have a steamer, you can simply put the broccoli directly into an inch of boiling water.) Add the broccoli to the steamer and cover; reduce heat to medium and let cook for 5-6 minutes. The broccoli is done when you can pierce it with a fork. As soon as it is pierce-able, remove from heat, place in serving dish.\nNote that green vegetables like broccoli will turn from vibrant green to drab olive green at about the 7 minute mark of cooking. So, watch the time, and don't let the broccoli overcook!\n3 Dress to taste with butter, olive oil, mayonnaise, lemon zest or juice, seasoned rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, ground black pepper, toasted almonds, or sesame seeds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Steamed broccoli is the best cure for over-indulgence I know. It’s cleansing, healthful, high in vitamin C, protein (45% of the calories in broccoli are from protein), and fiber.\nThe easiest way to dress broccoli is to dot it with dabs of butter. My favorite way to eat broccoli is to toss it with lots of freshly ground black pepper, and sprinkle it with a little seasoned rice vinegar. Black pepper, by the way, is one of those perfect pairings with broccoli.\nMy parents love their broccoli served with a little mayonnaise on the side, which is surprisingly good. You can also do olive oil and lemon zest (pictured above), olive oil and balsamic vinegar, etc. Good with toasted slivered almonds or toasted sesame seeds too.\n
552	Spinach Frittata	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n2 Cook spinach in 1/4 cup of water in a covered saucepan until just wilted, a couple minutes. Drain water and rinse with cold water to cool. Wrap the spinach in paper towels and squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Then chop and set aside. (If you are using tender baby spinach instead of mature spinach, you don't need to pre-cook, just chop and toss with the onions in step 3 until wilted).\n3 In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and Parmesan cheese. Add in chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.\n4 Sauté onions in olive oil in an oven-proof, stick-free skillet, until translucent, about 4-5 minutes on medium heat. Add the garlic and cook a minute further. Mix the cooked chopped spinach in with the onions and garlic.\n\n5 Spread out spinach mixture evenly on bottom of skillet. Pour egg mixture over spinach mixture. Use a spatula to lift up the spinach mixture along the sides of the pan to let egg mixture flow underneath.\nLeft: About to go in the oven; Right: Just removed from oven\n6 Sprinkle bits of goat cheese over the top of the frittata mixture. When the mixture is about half set, put the whole pan in the oven. Bake for 13-15 minutes, until frittata is puffy and golden. Remove from oven with oven mitts and let cool for several minutes. Although the pan may be out of the oven for a few minutes, the handle is still very hot. To keep from accidentally picking it up by the handle while hot (speaking from experience, ouch!) take a piece of ice and melt it against the pan's handle to cool it down.\nCut into quarters to serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	According to the Wikipedia a frittata is “a kind of Italian omelette that can contain cheese, vegetables, or even leftover pasta. Frittatas are cooked slowly. Most often, they are cooked on the stovetop on low heat until the eggs are set, then run under the broiler, but they can also be baked. Except for the cooking fat, all ingredients are fully mixed with the eggs before cooking starts.” I experimented with this frittata combination – eggs with spinach, onions, garlic, Parmesan, goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, and we all agreed here that the experiment was a success.\n
553	Liver and Onions	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Dredge the calves liver in seasoned flour.  Set aside.\n\n\n\n2 Heat a large cast iron skillet on medium high heat.  Add a teaspoon of bacon fat.  Sauté the onions until translucent, a couple of minutes.  Remove onions from pan with a slotted spoon.  Set aside onto a serving dish.\n\n3 Add a couple more teaspoons of bacon fat to the skillet.  Add the calves liver slices, working in batches.  Fry until browned on both sides.\n\n\n\nServe with sautéed onions (and ketchup!).\n\nServes four.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Once a month, my entire childhood, mom would serve us liver and onions for dinner. I think it was the only dish in which whining was even remotely tolerated. “Liver and onions, OH NOOOOO,” was the hue and cry from the assembled kids. Mom and dad never really forced us to eat anything. But, if you didn’t like what was on the table, there was no alternative. And complaining really wasn’t an option; one look from dad was enough to keep any of us quiet. My parents worked hard enough to put food on the table, and we knew it. It was for these quiet moments of culinary desperation that God invented ketchup. Ketchup was the only thing that could save us from the taste of overwhelming taste of liver, and we poured it on. The onions helped too.\nRecently mom and dad admitted to me that they don’t like liver that much; they made it as often as they did because (back then, before hormone-fed beef) it was good for us kids. I have been begging them for two years to make it again and they finally did tonight. “I’m sure this will be a popular one for the website,” laughed my dad. And you know what? It was good. Really good. Much better than I remember it being as a kid, and without all that ketchup. Two important points to remember when making liver, first, use the most organic, free-range, antibiotic, hormone-free calves liver you can. As full of vitamins and nutrients that liver is, it also collects the bad stuff, so get beef that is as free of chemicals as you can. Second, use calves liver, veal liver, or baby beef liver, not regular beef liver which is just too strong.\n
554	Seville Orange Marmalade	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreparing the fruit\nBitter Seville oranges, ready to cut\n1 Scrub the oranges clean. Discard any that are damaged or moldy.\n\n2 Cut the oranges in half and juice them, one by one, until you have 2 cups of juice. Set aside the juice. As you juice the oranges, also save the seeds and the membranes - put them in a separate bowl and set them aside. The seeds and membranes will be used for making pectin.\n\n3 Taking a clean juiced orange half rind, use a spoon to dig out as much of the white pith as you can. The pith is bitter, so the more you can get out the better. But don't worry if you can't get it all out. What is pictured is the end result of one of my scrapings. It's okay if there is still some pith. Use a sharp chef's knife to thinly julienne the peel. Once you julienne all of the oranges that you juiced to make 2 cups of juice, you should have about 4 cups of peel. Set these julienned peels aside.\n4 Juice the regular lemon and add this juice to the orange juice. Save the seeds for making pectin. Cut the Meyer lemon in eigths, lengthwise. Remove the seeds and as much of the inner membranes as you can easily remove. Cut the lemon segments crosswise into triangular pieces. (See the steps in the Meyer lemon marmalade recipe for photo descriptions.) Add the Meyer lemon seeds and membranes to the Seville orange seeds and membranes.\n\n5 Put all of the citrus seeds and membranes into 4 layers of cheesecloth, tied up tightly with string, or into a muslin jelly bag.\n \nFirst stage of cooking\n1 Place the orange and lemon juices into a large thick-bottomed pot, either 5 or 6-quart. Add the julienned orange peels and Meyer lemon pieces and the water.\n\n2 Place the cheesecloth or muslin bag containing the citrus seeds and pulp into the pot and secure the string at the other end to the pot handle. As the mixture cooks, the pectin from the seeds and membranes will be extracted into the mixture.\n\n3 Bring mixture to a boil. Let boil, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until the peels are soft and cooked through. Remove from heat.\n4 Remove the pectin bag and place it in a bowl to let cool until it is comfortable to touch.\n \nMeasure the fruit and add sugar and pectin\n1 Pour out the mixture from the pot into a large measuring cup. Measure how much of the mixture you have. Depending on how hard of a boil and how long the cooking time, you could have anywhere from 4 to 5 cups. Return the mixture back to the pan.\n2 Add to the mixture 7/8 cup of sugar for every cup of mixture. So, if you measured 4 cups of mixture, add in 3 1/2 cups of sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, taste the mixture. Add more sugar depending on how sweet you want your marmalade to be. Note that the jelly mixture will reduce further, intensifying both the flavor and the sweetness of the jelly. I typically use 4 cups of sugar for every 4 cups of fruit mixture.\nOnce your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, squeeze it like play-doh to extract extra pectin. Grasp a tangerine size portion of the bag and squeeze, pulling the bag away from you with one hand as you hold firmly with the other hand. Work your way around the bag. "Milk" the pectin until you have released anywhere from 2 Tbsp to 4 Tbsp of pectin. It should take a few minutes. The pectin has the consistency of sour cream. Add it to the orange mixture.\nSecond stage of cooking\n\n1 Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. The marmalade may take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes or so to set. After about 10 minutes, start checking it frequently.\n\n\nToo runny to be ready\nIt's wrinkly, so it's ready\n2 There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars. One way is to check the thermometer for when the mixture reaches a temperature of 220-222°F (8-10°F above the boiling point at your altitude). Another way is to put a bit of it on a chilled plate and look for signs of it "wrinkling up" when you push it with your finger tip. Depending on how accurate your thermometer is, you might find the wrinkle test more reliable. Put several small plates into the freezer. As the jelly temperature exceeds 218°F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn't ready. If it holds its shape a bit, that's a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.\nWhen you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. You may have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.\nI find the best jelly results from stopping the cooking as soon as the temp reaches 220° (I use a very accurate digital thermometer). At this point the test jelly is just barely wrinkling.\nOvercooking a marmalade will result in a caramelized flavor or tough orange peels in your marmalade.\nCanning\n1 There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.\n2 As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.\n\n3 Once the jelly has reached 220°F (or 8°F over the boiling temperature of water at your altitude) remove the jelly pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the jelly into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal. Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.\nIf you want, you can process the jars in a hot water bath for 5 minutes to help get a better seal and to help prevent mold. If you used boiling water in an earlier step to sterilize the jars, you can just keep the same set-up for the water bath. You want to make sure there is a rack at the bottom of the pot so that the jars aren't actually resting on the bottom of the pot.\n4 Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated March 10, 2008. Every year I make several batches of marmalade. These are the notes of this process, which continue to get refined as I improve the techniques in my quest for a remarkable marmalade.\nNote that this is not a standard recipe. It calls for twice as much fruit as other recipes for the same output, and makes a particularly flavorful, intense jam. This recipe doesn’t use commercial pectin, but requires that you extract the pectin from a cheesecloth or muslin bag containing the seeds and membranes of the oranges. If you are looking for a more classic recipe for Seville orange marmalade, I recommend David Lebovitz’s recipe from his book Room for Dessert.\n
555	Bittersweet Chocolate Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 325°F.  Grease the sides and bottom of a 10-inch springform pan.  Add a few tablespoons of sugar and gently shake so that all the sides and bottom of the pan are coated with sugar.  Tap out excess sugar.\n\n2 Beat egg yolks with the granulated sugar until they are thick and pale yellow and form a ribbon when they fall from the beater.\n\n3 Place chocolate and 3 Tbsp of water in the top of a double boiler.  Melt over simmering water, whisking until smooth.  If the chocolate gets too thick, and looks like it will firm up, whisk in a tablespoon or more of water.  Let cool slightly.  \n\n4 Fold the warm chocolate into the egg mixture.  Stir in the softened butter.  Stir in the grated orange peel.  Fold in the sifted flour.  Mix thoroughly but gently.\n\n5 Beat egg whites until stiff.  (See this wonderful explanation of whisking egg whites taken from La Bonne Cuisine de Madame Sant-Ange.)  Stir a large spoonful of the chocolate mixture into the beaten egg whites.  Mix well.  Pour this mixture into the chocolate mixture, fold together gently, incorporating the whites completely.  Be careful at this stage not to overmix.\n\n\n\n6 Turn batter into the springform pan.  It will come close to the top of the pan.  Set the pan on the middle rack of your oven and bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove the outer rim.  Allow the cake to cool completely before removing the bottom of the pan.  Refrigerate.\n\n7 When ready to serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar.\n\nMakes 20 small, but quite rich, servings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There is one day a year in which I will happily indulge in a piece of chocolate cake, and that is Valentine’s Day, which also happens to be my birthday. This is the cake I made for this year’s birthday fete. It comes from the classic Silver Palate Cookbook and includes the addition of a touch of grated orange peel. With almost a pound of chocolate, almost a pound of butter, a dozen eggs, and only one cup of flour, you can just imagine how delectably rich it is.\n
556	Rosemary Duck with Apricots	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the rosemary, brown sugar, black pepper, and salt.  Rub the mixture over the duck breasts.  Cover and chill 2 hours.  Rinse duck with cold water, pat dry.\n\n2 If the duck breasts are very fatty, score the skin side with a sharp knife. Be careful not to cut the meat. Lay the duck breast halves skin side down in a cold sauté pan and turn on the heat to medium-high. (Yes, start with a cold pan.) Once you hear the duck breasts sizzle, turn the heat down to medium and allow to cook undisturbed until the skin is brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. \n\n3 Turn the duck breast over and cook another 2-3 minutes, depending on how well done you like your duck. Use the finger test to check for doneness. As a final step, tip the duck breasts on their sides — thick side down — and let them sizzle another minute or so. Remove to a cutting board to rest. \n\n4 While the duck is cooking, combine the granulated sugar and vinegar in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until thick and amber-colored (about 5 minutes). Add apricots; reduce heat, and cook for 1 minute or until the apricots begin to soften. To serve, cut duck diagonally across the grain into slices.  Serve with carmelized apricots.\n\nVariation:\n\nYou can instead roast a whole duck.  Here are the steps (also from Keith):\n\n1  Rinse off the duck, outside and inside, pat dry.  Remove any remaining feathers.  Prick the skin all over with a sharp-tined fork, taking care not to prick the meat.  Rub the duck all over with a little bit of olive oil.  Rub the rosemary mixture all over the duck and some in the cavity.  Tie the legs together loosely.  Put in a plastic bag and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.\n\n2  At least a half an hour before you plan to cook the duck, remove from the refrigerator so it can get to room temperature.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Place the duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, breast side up.  Pour a cup of water into the pan.   Roast for 45 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and pour off the fat and water.  Separate the fat to use for basting.\n\n3  Turn the bird on the rack so now the breast is facing down.  Baste the bird with the fat.  Return the bird to the oven.  Increase the temperature to 400°F.  Estimate a total cooking time of 15 minutes per lb of bird.  So if you have a 4 lb duck, cook it another 30 minutes.  The bird is done when the juices run clear from a thigh pricked all the way down to the joint and when a meat thermometer inserted in the inner thigh below the leg joint reads 175 to 180 degrees.  Be careful not to overcook the duck.  When the bird is done, transfer it to a platter and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This recipe comes by way of my Tennessee friend Keith Gray, who when I asked him, “does this recipe work with ducks you shoot, or that you buy in a grocery store?,” replied with a puzzled look, “I’ve never bought duck in a store, but I guess it would work.” Thanks Keith for introducing our family to a delicious way to prepare duck!\n
557	Orange and Beet Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook the beets with their peel on.  I prefer the boiling method because it's more efficient - cover the beets with water, bring to a boil, and simmer for 30 minutes or until beets can easily be pierced through with a fork.  Alternatively you can wrap the beets in aluminum foil and bake them in the oven at 400°F for an hour or until done.  After cooking, allow the beets to come to room temperature and remove their peels.  Slice or quarter them.  If you have time, place them in a small bowl and marinate them in half of the oil and vinegar dressing, ingredients listed above.\n\n2 Compose individual salad plates with arugula, a few slices of orange, a few beets, a few slices of red onion and a few chopped walnuts.  If you want some added color, gently add a few slices of the orange to the beet juice from your bowl of beets.  Let the oranges absorb the beet color and use in your salad.  Sprinkle dressing over the individual salads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here’s an orange and beet salad to brighten up a Winter day. The peppery arugula complements the sweetness of the beets and oranges.\n
609	Spanish Rice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large skillet brown rice in olive oil, medium/high heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook onion rice mixture, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes, or until onions are softened. \n\n2  In a separate sauce pan bring stock to a simmer. Add tomato sauce, oregano, and salt. Add rice to broth. Bring to a simmer. Cover. Lower heat and cook 15-25 minutes, depending on the type of rice and the instructions on the rice package. Turn off heat and let sit for 5 minutes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of my mother’s signature dishes is her Spanish rice, a delicious accompaniment to steak, chicken, and Mexican entrees such as tacos or enchiladas. Spanish rice is prepared by browning the rice first with onions and garlic, before cooking it in chicken stock with added tomato. The browning is essential to the nutty, almost toasty flavor of the rice. And although bouillon can be substituted for the chicken stock, nothing beats homemade chicken stock, the rich flavor of which is absorbed by the rice.\n
558	Mushroom Quiche	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 10-by-1 1/2-inch round tart pan (with or without a removable bottom), pressing dough into corners. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°. Line pastry with parchment paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges. Fill at least two-thirds with baking weights - dried beans, rice, or aluminum pie weights. Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper and weights. Poke the bottom of the pie pan with the tongs of a fork and return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden.  (Fork holes are for any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making filling.\n\n\n\n3 Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add shallots, and cook, stirring, until translucent but not brown, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms first release their liquid and then liquid evaporates and mushrooms are dark golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n4  Place tart pan on a baking sheet to catch any run-off there might be (especially if you are using a pan with a removable bottom.)  Sprinkle half the cheese evenly over the bottom of the crust. Spread mushrooms over the cheese and then top with remaining cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, cream, and eggs. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Pour over cheese. Transfer to oven, and bake until just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes before slicing.\n\n\n\nServes 6-8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Now I see why people use frozen pie-crusts to make quiche. It’s a lot of work to make the crust from scratch, especially when you “blind bake” (pre-bake) the crust. But there is nothing better than a real butter crust, and for that reason alone we do the extra work. I’ve had an inkling for mushroom quiche for quite some time, and this one turned out wonderfully.\n
559	Simple Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Remove just the tomatoes from the can of whole tomatoes, place in a medium sized non-reactive mixing bowl. Using your fingers, or a fork and a sharp small knife, shred or break up the tomatoes.\n\n2 Mix in chopped green chiles, green onions, garlic (or garlic salt), olive oil and vinegar. Add back in about 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce from the can of whole tomatoes. Sprinkle on about 1/4 teaspoon of dried oregano. Mix in and taste. Adjust if needed. Add cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste.\nRefrigerate when not using. Will keep several days.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There are two basic types of tomato-based salsas – salsa made with fresh tomatoes and salsa made with cooked tomatoes. When cooking salsa, as we do when we make enchiladas, we always use the cooked-tomato version, not the fresh. This particular salsa is popular in the north, or Sonoran part of Mexico, because of its use of Anaheim green chiles.\nStarting at age seven it was my job to make salsa for our family, which I did at least once a week for ten years. This is the recipe we used, the only difference between now and the mid-60s is that now you can get some very good canned “fire-roasted” tomatoes, perfect for salsa making. Why used canned tomatoes? If you live where we do, and in most places in the U.S., you can only get great fresh tomatoes maybe 2 months out of the year. If you do have access to good tomatoes and want to make the effort to roast them yourself, go for it – put several tomatoes under a broiler until the skin is blistered all over, remove from the oven, let cool, remove the skin. You can do the same with the anaheim chiles. Yet, the beauty of this recipe is that it is something a 7-year old can make in about 10 minutes – pretty useful when you are trying to get dinner on the table. And speaking of dinner, the way we usually serve our salsa? with steak and refried beans.\n
560	Oven-Roasted Salmon, Asparagus and New Potatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  In a large, shallow baking dish (not glass, as it might break in an oven that hot) coat the potatoes with olive oil and salt.  Arrange the potatoes, cut side down, in the baking dish and roast for 10-12 minutes, until the potatoes begin to brown on the bottom.  Turn the potatoes over and roast another 10 minutes until browned on top.  Remove the baking dish from the oven.\n\n2 In a medium bowl, toss the asparagus with the chopped dill, lemon zest, garlic, salt and a little olive oil.  Add the asparagus mixture to the potatoes and stir to combine.\n\n3 Push the vegetables to the side of the dish to make room for the salmon.  If you are using fillets, put them skin side down. Salt the salmon well and return the baking dish to the oven. Roast the salmon and asparagus for 10 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through.\n\nIf you want, remove the skin and center bones (if you are using steaks), and arrange on individual plates before serving.  Garnish with fresh dill and lemon wedges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My dad pulled out a favorite recipe today to make and share with “the people on the website.” A “discussion” then ensued between the rental units for at least half an hour along the lines of “What do you mean this is a favorite recipe? You always told me you didn’t like salmon.” “What are you talking about? I used to make this all the time.” “You’ve never made it in this house!…” and so on and so on. Turns out my mother’s preferred method of cooking any fish is to pan-fry it, coated with cornmeal. Pan-frying salmon tends to leave odoriferous remnants (it stinks up the house) which my father really doesn’t appreciate. Likely he did cook it often enough, just not when mom was around, lest she get ideas about cooking salmon herself. Just a theory of course, I didn’t stick around to see the outcome of this particular chat…\nAccording to the notes accompanying this recipe indicate that cooking fish at a high temperature in the oven seals in the flavor and helps get dinner out quickly. Excellent, easy dish.\n
561	Caramel Walnuts	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a small, thick-bottomed saucepan, mix together and heat the sour cream, salt, milk, and sugar. Heat until the temperature reads 240°F on a candy thermometer, stirring occasionally.\n2 Add the walnuts and a teaspoon of vanilla. Stir until the walnuts are creamy. Remove pan from heat and spread the walnuts out on wax paper or Silpat. Separate using 2 forks if necessary. Let cool to harden.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	These homemade, candied caramel walnuts are a little sticky, and a little chewy, but oh so good.\n
562	Cilantro Pesto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a food processor, pulse the cilantro, almonds, onion, chile, and salt until well blended. With the food processor running, slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream.\nAdd more oil as needed for your use.\nMakes about 1 cup.\nWhatever you don't use, you can freeze. Line a ice cube tray with plastic wrap and fill in the individual cube spaces with the pesto. Freeze and remove from the ice tray, put in a sealed freezer bag for future use.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I have, over the years, attempted to grow cilantro several times. Each time the plants bolted before I got much use out of them. This year I planted a bunch of seed in October, when the scorching Sacramento summer weather cooled down, and the plants have been thriving for months. As the cilantro gets more mature, the stems thicken and the leaves get much bigger, signaling “pre-bolt” and a good time to make cilantro pesto. Unlike basil pesto, this pesto requires no Parmesan or garlic. The complementary flavors are red onion and serrano chile instead. Also, almonds are used instead of pine nuts. Almonds seem to enhance the flavor of the cilantro, rather than compete with it. Use with pasta, as a filling, or with chicken in tacos. Some of this batch got mixed in with some cottage cheese for a delicious tortilla chip dip.\n
563	Cranberry Nut Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Pre-heat oven to 350°F.\n2 Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the chopped cranberries and walnuts to coat with the flour mixture.\n3 Mix together orange juice, sugar, butter, egg, and orange peel. Add to flour, cranberry, nut mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just blended.\n4 Pour into a greased 9x5 or 8x4 loaf pan. Bake at 350°F for 55 to 60 minutes or until done (a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean).\n5 Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of the great blessings of living in California is our abundance of produce year round. Walnuts are in season, as are navel oranges. Buy an orange and squeeze it fresh to get the best juice for this recipe (grate the peel first). Frozen cranberries work well, just slice them in half. I’ve seen suggestions online to pulse the cranberries in a food processor as a way to more easily chop them, but I think you could easily get too many small bits using that method. The best results will come from chopping them yourself, all they need is to be cut in half, just cut a few at a time to keep them from rolling off the table. The result is a tangy, slightly sweet bread with occasional explosions of cranberry tartness, mellowed with walnuts.\n
564	Nachos	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Arrange a layer of tortilla chips along the bottom of a wide, shallow baking pan. It will make things easier if this baking pan also can be used as a serving pan, such as the ceramic platter shown in the photo above. The layer of tortilla chips can be a couple chips thick. Spread the refried beans over the chips (this is why you need extra thick chips, so they don't break when encountering the beans). Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top of chips and beans. Sprinkle slices of jalapeño peppers over the cheese. Bake in oven for 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted. 5 minutes in a convection oven.\n2 Serve with dollops of salsa, sour cream and guacamole, with chopped cilantro sprinkled on top.\nWhat is pictured above is a half-recipe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Nachos are considered more “Tex Mex” than Mexican, being an invention of one Ignacio “Nacho” Anaya, a restaurateur serving American servicemen in the 1940s. At their essence, they are simply a layer of tortilla chips with melted cheddar cheese and jalapeño peppers. Unfortunately, the sports stadium concessionaires got a hold of the nachos idea and ruined it by using melted, processed Velveeta cheese, instead of real cheddar. So now, many people think that that’s what nachos are. How distressing! Nachos are all about the ingredients – the best tortilla chips, freshly made refried pinto beans, grated cheddar cheese, jalapeño peppers, salsa, guacamole, sour cream and fresh cilantro.\n\nCanned refried beans can be used for this recipe, of course. But you are truly missing out by not trying to make your beans fresh. It’s a whole other world. Regarding the salsa, there are two kinds of tomato salsa that we use often, one with fresh tomatoes and one with cooked. We used to make the cooked tomato salsa from scratch, but there are so many great prepared salsas on the market these days, that we don’t ours from scratch very often. This recipe works best with the cooked tomato salsa, but really, you can use any salsa.\n
565	Cinnamon Sticky Buns	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Make the dough. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine warm water, yeast and 1 tsp. sugar. Stir to dissolve and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. \nAdd milk, butter, remaining sugar, egg yolks, orange zest, salt and 3 cups flour. Mix on low speed until blended. Switch to a dough hook and then, again on low speed, slowly incorporate the remaining 1 cup of flour. Increase speed to medium, kneading dough until smooth and slightly sticky (adding a little more flour if too wet), 3 to 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a large, buttered bowl. Turn dough over in bowl to coat with the butter from the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour (or 2 hours if not in an entirely warm place). After the dough has risen, punch down. Turn out onto a lightly floured cutting board and let sit 20 minutes.\n\n2 Make the filling. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Melt butter; keep separate.\n3 Roll dough out into a 12" x 18" rectangle. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Starting with the long side, roll dough into a cylinder. Place seam side down on a flat surface and cut crosswise into 15 slices.\n\n\n4 Make the topping. In a 1-quart saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter, honey and corn syrup over low heat; stir until sugar and butter are melted. Pour mixture into a greased 9" x 13" pan and sprinkle pecans on top.\n\n5 Place dough slices, flat side down, on top of prepared topping. Crowd them so they touch. Cover with plastic wrap, leaving room for the buns to rise, and refrigerate overnight.\n6 Remove the rolls from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature while the oven pre-heats. Preheat oven to 375°. Bake buns until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove pan from oven and immediately (and carefully as not to spill hot topping on your toes!) invert onto a serving tray or baking dish. Let buns cool slightly and serve warm.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“Elise, I absolutely forbid you from making these again,” exclaimed my father in exasperation after his fifth sticky bun from this batch. “That good, eh? I’m glad you like them,” I answered smiling. We finally had to freeze the few remaining, lest we completely destroy our appetites for the entire day. The problem with these sticky buns, loaded with melted brown sugar and pecans, is that they are irresistible. And, once you have one, you must have another. The recipe is adapted from this month’s (February, 2006) Oprah Magazine. (It does make you wonder, with Oprah’s ongoing emphasis on weight-loss, the logic of publishing recipes like these. But then again, moderation is the key, and if you are going to eat something sweet, better make it good!)\n
566	Stuffed, Braised Pork Shoulder	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add the pork roast, opening it up to expose all sides, and turn to coat all over with the marinade. Let the pork marinate in the refrigerator several hours, turning it occasionally. Remove from refrigerator and bring to room temperature before proceeding. Remove the pork from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. Reserve the marinade; you'll use it later in the braise.\n2 For the stuffing, smash the garlic cloves and then mince. Add to a medium bowl and mix with some salt and pepper. Combine the remaining stuffing ingredients until the mixture has the consistency of a paste.\n\n3 Open up the pork roast to expose where the bone had been. Smear the stuffing onto this surface. Tie up the pork roast to enclose the stuffing. Rub the pork with olive oil.\n\n4 Place the pork in a large roasting pan and sear it in a pre-heated 425°F oven for 30 minutes or until the surface is golden brown. Remove the pork to a Dutch oven just large enough to contain it. (We used a 2 1/2 quart Le Creuset.)\n\n5 Drain off the fat from the roasting pan, then strain the marinade into the pan and heat, stirring to deglaze the pan juices. While deglazing, in a separate saucepan bring stock to a boil.\n\n6 Pour the heated marinade over the pork and add enough boiling stock to come one-half or two-thirds of the way up the side of the meat. Cover the pot and place it in a 325°F oven for about one and a half hours.\n\n7 Transfer the meat to a cutting board. Strain the liquid from the pot into a small saucepan, let settle enough to skim the fat, and simmer until the sauce is reduced by half. Remove the strings from the meat, slice it or cut it into wedges, and serve with the sauce. Excellent served with mashed potatoes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe and photos updated July, 2013\nWe had a hankering for a pork roast recently and found this relatively easy stuffed pork shoulder recipe in an old The Good Cook cookbook on pork from Time Life (1979). These Time Life Good Cook books are by the way terrific if you can get a hold of them, filled with details of methods of an earlier time.\n
567	Seared Tuna with Avocado	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a bowl, combine the cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, garlic, lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, salt, sesame oil and olive oil.  If you want, you can purée the sauce in a blender or food processor.\n\n\n\n2 Heat a large skillet on high heat for one minute.  Coat the pan with the grapeseed or canola oil and let heat up for 30 to 45 seconds. Sprinkle the tuna pieces with salt. Sear the tuna for a minute on each side. \n\n3 Transfer the seared tuna to a bowl and coat with some of the sauce. Pour some sauce on the plates, top with the tuna and serve with the sliced avocado and a wedge of lime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe and photo updated July 25th, 2011\nOne of the benefits of having your own cooking website is that your friends and relatives start sending you recipes to try. The basis for this recipe comes by way of my cousin Laurie in Maryland (thanks Laurie!) and we’ve played with it a little. It’s hard to go wrong when the ingredients include cilantro, avocado, jalapeños, lime, garlic, and sushi-grade tuna. The recipe calls for lightly searing raw tuna on each side and then serving. I love tuna done this way, but the tuna has to be very high quality. My parents, on the other hand, have no intention of ever eating raw fish, sushi-grade or not. They cook their fish all the way through, so it is a little translucent in the middle, but definitely cooked. They loved it. \n
568	Turnip and Potato Patties	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the turnip and potato cubes for 15 to 17 minutes, until they are tender, and drain them.  In a bowl, mash them with a fork and stir in the scallions, the egg, flour, and salt and pepper to taste.\n\n2 Coat the bottom of a large, heavy bottomed skillet with about 1/4-inch of the oil.  Heat the pan on medium high heat until the surface of the oil begins to shimmer, but not smoke.  Spoon 1/4-cup mounds of the turnip potato batter into the pan, flattening them into 1/2-inch thick patties with the back of a spatula.  Fry the patties until they are golden, turning them once, about 4 minutes on each side.  Transfer the patties to paper towels to drain off excess oil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Dad found this recipe for turnip and potato patties in an old (1985) issue of Gourmet magazine and made them the other night. They were terrific, not too turnipy. Sort of a cross between a pancake and a fritter.\n
854	Chile Verde	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1  Remove papery husks from tomatillos and rinse well. Cut in half and place cut side down, along with 5 unpeeled garlic cloves, on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Place under a broiler for about 5-7 minutes to lightly blacken the skin.  Remove from oven, let cool enough to handle.  \n\nIf you want the additional flavor of chiles other than jalapenos, you can add a couple Anaheim or poblano chiles.  Either use canned  green chiles or roast fresh chilies over a gas flame or under the broiler until blackened all around.  Let cool in a bag, remove the skin, seeds, and stem.  \n\n\n\n2  Place tomatillos, skins included, into blender.  Remove the now roasted garlic cloves from their skins, add them to the blender. Add chopped Jalapeño peppers, other chilies (if you are using them), and cilantro to the blender. Pulse until all ingredients are finely chopped and mixed. \n\n\n\n3 Season the pork cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium high heat and brown pork chunks well on all sides. Work in batches so that the pork is not crowded in the pan and has a better chance to brown well.  Using a slotted spoon or tongs, lift pork out of pan and place in bowl, set aside. \n\n4 Pour off excess fat, anything beyond a tablespoon, and place the onions and garlic in the same skillet and cook, stirring occasionally until limp, about 5 minutes.  If your skillet is large enough to cook the entire batch of chile verde, with the sauce and meat, then add the pork back to the pan.  If not, get a large soup pot and add the onion mixture and the pork to it.  Add the oregano to the pan.  Add the tomatillo chile verde sauce to the pork and onions.  Add the chicken stock (enough to cover the meat).  Add a pinch of ground cloves.  Add a little salt and pepper. (Not too much as the chile verde will continue to cook down and concentrate a bit.)\n\n\n\n5 Bring to a boil and reduce to a slight simmer. Cook for 2-3 hours uncovered or until the pork is fork tender. \n\nAdjust the seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.   Serve with Spanish rice and warmed flour tortillas or freshly made corn tortillas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Walk into almost any taqueria in this country and you will find chile verde on the menu. The chile will likely be made with chunks of pork shoulder, slow cooked in a green chile sauce of jalapeno chiles, garlic, and tomatillos. It’s a favorite filling for burritos and tacos, and wonderful just on its own with a bit of rice and tortillas. Many recipes call for puréeing raw tomatillos and adding them to the pork to cook. In this recipe we roast the tomatillos first, browning their skins, to bring out more flavor. I recently begged this recipe from my Acapulco friend, Arturo Vargas who was surprised I wanted it. “But Elise, it’s so easy, anyone can make chile verde.” Gracias, Arturo. We loved it.\n
569	Shrimp Cakes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpice Mix Method\n\nAdd cumin seeds, peppercorns, and coriander to a heavy medium skillet.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 8 minutes.  Let cool a few minutes. Grind spices in a blender or spice grinder (can use a coffee grinder that has been cleaned by grinding raw rice) until finely ground.  Transfer to a small bowl, stir in sugar and salt.  Makes about half a cup.  You'll only need 1 1/2 teaspoons of the spice mix for one shrimp cakes recipe, so store the remainder for future use.\n\nShrimp Cakes Method\n\n1 Pierce sweet potatoes all over with a fork.  Bake in microwave for about 15 minutes until done.  Rub one tablespoon of oil over unpeeled garlic.  Cook in microwave a few minutes, until soft.  Let the garlic and sweet potatoes cool enough to handle.  Peel the garlic.  Cut the sweet potato in half and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh.  Combine the cooked sweet potato and garlic in a bowl and mash until smooth.\n\n2 Add the shrimp, cilantro, breadcrumbs, jalapeño, onion, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Spice Mix.  Mix until well blended.  Season with salt.  Use your hands to form the mixture into six patties,  3-inches in diameter.\n\n3 Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Lightly dust the shrimp cakes in flour.  Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, cook the shrimp cakes until nicely browned, adding more oil as needed, about 2 minutes per side.  Place the shrimp cakes on a baking sheet.  Bake until heated through, about 5 minutes.\n\nTastes great served with lemon, tartar sauce, and coleslaw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of our hands-down favorite recipes is this one for shrimp cakes. My father pulled the original recipe from Bon Appetit magazine years ago, which he has since changed just ever so slightly. Dad doesn’t even like shrimp, and usually refuses to eat it, but he loves making and eating these shrimp cakes. The base is made with sweet potatoes and they are seasoned with spices, jalapeno chiles and cilantro. This really is one of the best recipes on this site, so if you have even an inkling for making these, do it!\n
570	Strawberry Shortcake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRemove the stems from the strawberries.  Slice into thin (1/4" to 1/8") slices.  Put into a large bowl.  Add 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of sugar (depending on how sweet the strawberries are to begin with) and mix into the strawberries.  Set aside at room temperature to macerate (which means that the sugar will soften the strawberries and help release their juices).\n\nAfter the strawberries have been sitting for 20 minutes or so, take a potato masher and mash them a little.  Not too much, just enough to get more juice out of them. \n\nWhip the cream, adding a drop or two of vanilla and a teaspoon of sugar.\n\nTo serve, break up one biscuit per person into big pieces into a bowl.  Ladle strawberries over the biscuit.  Add a dolop of whipped cream.\n\nBiscuits from scratch\n\n3 cups all purpose flour\n3 Tbsp granulated sugar\n1 1/2 Tbsp baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n12 Tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream\n1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extractSift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl.  Toss with a fork to combine.  Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter or a fork until the largest pieces of butter are the size of peas.  (Or pulse several times in a food processor.)  Combine the cream and vanilla in a liquid measure.  Make a well in the center of the flour and and pour the cream mixture into the well.  Mix with a fork until the dough is evenly moistened and just combined; it should look shaggy and still feel a little dry.  Gently knead by hand five or six times to create a loose ball.  \n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat it into an 8-inch square, 3/4 to 1 inch thick.  Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment or silpat, cover with plastic and chill for 20 minutes in the refrigerator.  Heat the oven to 425ºF.   Remove the dough from refrigerator.  Cut the dough into 9 even squares and spread them about 2 inches apart from each other on the baking sheet.  Bake until the biscuits are medium golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.\n\nMakes 9 biscuits.  (Adapted from Fine Cooking Magazine, July 2003)\n\nBisquick biscuits:\n\n2 1/3 cups Bisquick baking mix\n3 Tbsp butter, melted\n1/2 cup milk\n3 Tbsp sugarThe strawberry shortcake biscuit recipe used to be on the side of the Bisquick box.  For some unfathomable reason, the company has started to print the recipe on the inside of the box.  Talk about not understanding your customers!  If you can't find the recipe, here it is:\n\nHeat oven to 425°F.  Stir baking mix, melted butter, milk, and 3 Tbsp of sugar in a mixing bowl until soft dough forms.  Drop by 6 spoonfuls on to a greased cookie sheet.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.  \n\nMakes 6 biscuits.\n\nGluten-free biscuits:\n\n1-1/2 cups Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour (Bob's Red Mill)\n1 Tbsp. Sugar \n2 tsp. Baking Powder \n1/4 tsp. Baking Soda \n1 tsp. Xanthan Gum \n1 tsp. Guar Gum \n1/2 tsp. Salt 1/4 cup Shortening \n1/2 cup Milk \n1 large Egg White Preheat oven to 350º. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or grease lightly. \n\nIn food processor, pulse dry ingredients (flour through salt) with shortening until mixture is consistency of small peas. Add milk and egg white. Blend until dough forms ball, scraping down sides with spatula, if necessary. Dough will be somewhat soft. \n\nPlace dough on parchment-lined or greased baking sheet that’s been lightly dusted with rice flour. Gently pat to 3/4-inch thick circle with hands or spatula. Lightly dust dough with rice flour. Cut into ten 2-inch circles with floured biscuit cutter. Shape remaining dough to 3/4-inch thick and cut again. If dough is sticky, lightly dust with more flour. Arrange evenly on baking sheet. \n\nBake 12-15 minutes or until nicely browned. Best when served warm or gently reheated in microwave oven. Serves 10.  (Recipe from Bob's Red Mill)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What better way to conjure up memories of the joys of youth than strawberry shortcake? Strawberry shortcake consists of sliced strawberries that have been macerated with whipped cream served over a white cake or biscuit. I’m from the camp that insists that strawberry shortcake is made with a biscuit, not a cake. Growing up we always made the shortcake biscuits with Bisquick baking mix, which now, thankfully, has a zero-transfat version of their product. The best of course are biscuits made from scratch, using butter and cream. I’ve included recipes here for excellent homemade biscuits, the Bisquick biscuits, and also wheat and gluten-free biscuits for those who don’t want to give up strawberry shortcake just because they can’t eat wheat.\n
571	How to Make Preserved Lemons	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place 2 Tbsp of salt in the bottom of a sterilized jar.\n2 One by one, prepare the lemons in the following way. Cut off any protruding stems from the lemons, and cut 1/4 inch off the tip of each lemon. Cut the lemons as if you were going to cut them in half lengthwize, starting from the tip, but do not cut all the way. Keep the lemon attached at the base. Make another cut in a similar manner, so now the lemon is quartered, but again, attached at the base.\n\n3 Pry the lemons open and generously sprinkle salt all over the insides and outsides of the lemons.\n4 Pack the lemons in the jar, squishing them down so that juice is extracted and the lemon juice rises to the top of the jar. Fill up the jar with lemons, make sure the top is covered with lemon juice. Add more fresh squeezed lemon juice if necessary. Top with a couple tablespoons of salt.\n5 Seal the jar and let sit at room temperature for a couple days. Turn the jar upside down ocassionally. Put in refrigerator and let sit, again turning upside down ocassionally, for at least 3 weeks, until lemon rinds soften.\n6 To use, remove a lemon from the jar and rinse thoroughly in water to remove salt. Discard seeds before using. Discard the pulp before using, if desired.\n7 Store in refrigerator for up to 6 months.\nNote:\nYou can add spices to the lemons for preserving - cloves, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, bay leaf.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Many Moroccan and Middle Eastern recipes call for preserved lemons, lemons that have been pickled in salt and their own juices. It’s quite easy to do, though takes at least three weeks before the lemons are ready to use.\n
572	Irish Beef Stew	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Sprinkle about a teaspoon of salt over the beef pieces. Heat the olive oil in a large (6 to 8 quart), thick-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Pat dry the beef with paper towels and working in batches, add the beef (do not crowd the pan, or the meat will steam and not brown) and cook, without stirring, until nicely browned on one side, then use tongs to turn the pieces over and brown on another side.\n\n2 Add garlic to the pot with the beef and sauté 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add the beef stock, water, Guinness, red wine, tomato paste, sugar, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, and bay leaves. Stir to combine. Bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to the lowest setting, then cover and cook at a bare simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.\n\n3 While the pot of meat and stock is simmering, melt the butter in another pot over medium heat. Add the onions and carrots. Sauté the onions and carrots until the onions are golden, about 15 minutes. Set aside until the beef stew in step 2 has simmered for one hour.\n\n4 Add the onions, carrots, and the potatoes to the beef stew. Add black pepper and two teaspoons of salt. Simmer uncovered until vegetables and beef are very tender, about 40 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Tilt pan and spoon off any excess fat. Transfer stew to serving bowl. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“Have I got the best recipe for you!” my friend Tomas announced, upon his return from a trip to photograph vineyards in Italy. “It’s an Irish beef stew,” he added, “and it’s the best thing I’ve ever had.” Apparently the chef at one of the wineries Tom was visiting prepared this stew for Tom, based on a Bon Appetit recipe, with the main difference being the substitution of Guinness (a very dark beer) and excellent red wine for some of the beef stock the recipe called for. Always eager to try new recipes with friends, I made my way to Tom’s house and we cooked this up together for his family. As I suspected, the addition of Guinness and red wine makes all the difference.\n
583	Asparagus	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the asparagus by rinsing them thoroughly, break off any tough, white bottoms and discard. Cut into 1 to 2 inch sections, slicing the asparagus at a slight diagonal.\n2 Fill a medium sized saucepan half way with water, bring to a boil. Add the asparagus and reduce heat slightly to a simmer. Parboil the asparagus for exactly 2 minutes. Drain the hot water. While the asparagus are still hot, toss them in a bowl with the olive oil, Parmesan, and lemon rind. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm or room temperature.\nNote that when you are working with so few ingredients, it's important to make sure they are of the highest quality.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Selland’s market-cafe in Sacramento is an uncommonly good café and often a source of inspiration for foods to prepare. Recently I had some of their asparagus and loved the texture – slightly crunchy (definitely not mushy!) – and the hint of lemon flavor along with the olive oil and Parmesan. Upon inquiry I was told that the asparagus had indeed been parboiled for 2 minutes and then tossed with Parmesan, olive oil, and some lemon zest. So easy!\n
573	Artichoke Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Prepare the artichoke hearts. Peel off the leaves from around the artichokes until you get to the thistly choke in the center. (Note, we save most of the leaves to steam separately and eat dipped in melted butter or mayonnaise. Why waste perfectly good artichoke leaves?)  With a small knife, remove the thistle choke part and discard. Cut or peel away the tough outside skin of the stems and discard.  You can keep one to two inches of the stem on the artichoke heart. Longer stems you can discard. Slice the hearts or chop to a quarter inch thickness.\n\n2 Melt the butter in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium heat.  Add the artichoke hears, leek, garlic, and shallots. Cook until tender, but not brown. Add the peeled diced potatoes and the stock. Wrap the herbs (bay leaf, thyme, parsley) and peppercorns in cheesecloth and place in the pot. Increase the heat to bring the soup to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook uncovered, for 1 hour.\n\n3 After an hour, remove and discard the herbs. Purée the soup and use a rubber spatula to push it through a fine mesh sieve. At this point you can make ahead and refrigerate until ready to serve. When you are ready to serve, heat the soup and stir in the remaining butter and the cream. Season with salt to taste and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The foggy coastline of Northern California is artichoke country. Like finding small hole-in-the-walls that serve clam chowder in New England, here one can sometimes find local diners that sell delicous artichoke soup. I first developed a taste for artichoke soup on frequent trips to Pescadero Beach during college. So when I found this recipe in the New York Times, I couldn’t resist. Over the years we’ve changed it up a little bit, mostly reducing the butter and cream. The soup is wonderfully rich, smooth, and creamy.\n
574	Low Sugar Red Raspberry Jam	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a stainless steel pot, combine raspberries (whole, do not mash them) and water.  Begin heating on medium high heat.  Stir occasionally, then frequently as the fruit gets hot.\n\n2 In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of Pomona's pectin with 2/3 cup of the sugar.  Mix thoroughly.  When the fruit reaches 200°F (use a candy thermometer) reduce heat to low.  Slowly sprinkle in the pectin mixture while stirring.  A sifter with a squeeze handle works well.\n\n3 Stir the fruit/pectin mix for 3 minutes.  Maintain temperature at 185°F to 195°F.  Do not boil.  If the mixture seems very thick, add a little more water.\n\n4 Add the balance of the sugar while stirring. The sugar will cool the mixture.  Heat as necessary to keep the jam at about 185°F.\n\n5 Adjust the heat to hold the jam at the filling temperature of 185°F.  Skim off any foam and fill fill into sterile jars, leaving hot headspace of 1/4 inch.  Headspace will increase as jam cools and shrinks.  Cap each jar immediately after it is filled.\n\n6 Process the filled jars in a boiling water bath for 5-10 minutes.  The red raspberry jam will have better color if processed for only 5 minutes, but a shorter shelf life.  After processing let the jars cool undisturbed for 12 hours.\n\nNotes on recipe:\n\nLow sugar jams have a shorter shelf life than regular jams.  If possible, store unopened jars in the refrigerator.  Opened jars must be refrigerated.  Typical shelf lives are:\n\nUnopened jars, refrigerated: 6 months\nUnopened jars, not refrigerated: 3 months\nOpened jar, refrigerated: 2 months\n\nFreeze your berries then thaw before jamming.  Berries that have been frozen are softer and are less likely to burn.\n\nPomona pectin calls for the addition of calcium (supplied with the box) when making low sugar jam.  The pectin reacts with both the sugar and the calcium to gel.  If you are using whole raspberries, the seeds in the raspberries contain enough calcium and you do not need to add more calcium.  If you are using seedless raspberry purée, you will need to increase the pectin and add calcium.\n\nIf the jam foams badly, you may be applying too much heat.  Lower the burner setting and do not let the temp go over 200°F.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	In 2006, as part of the worldwide Annual Independent Food Festival and Awards hosted by Hillel of Tasting Menu, I presented the The Best Excuse For Not Making It Yourself Red Raspberry Jam award to Summerfield Farm in Placerville, CA, for Art Summerfield’s Reduced Sugar Red Raspberry Preserves.\n \nWhy are Art’s jams so good?\nLow Sugar Art uses a lot less sugar than regular jam, which means that you can taste more of the raspberry; it’s not smothered under excessive sweetness.\nSmall Batches Art makes all the jams himself, in small batches – 4 to 5 gallons at a time. This way he can get heat the berries up quickly, get them to 190°F to kill any bacteria, and cool them quickly. Art told me that most people cook their jam too long. All you need is enough cooking to kill the bugs. Beyond that, the more you cook it, the more flavor you lose.\nBecause the jam has much less sugar than regular jams, it is more perishable. Sugar works as a preservative, with less sugar you have less natural preservative. The jam should be kept in the refrigerator, even if it hasn’t been opened, and should be eaten within a couple of months. The jam won’t go bad, but it will lose its color and flavor over time. \n
575	Crab Bisque	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaking the stock\nBefore making the bisque, you'll need to make the shellfish stock (see these instructions for details and photos).\n1 Break crab shells into smaller pieces by putting in a sealed, thick plastic bag and either rolling with a rolling pin or hitting with a meat hammer to crush. Don't crush too small. You can even skip this step if you want, if your shell pieces are already well broken up. Put in a large stock pot and cover with an inch (but no more than an inch) of water.\n2 Put the stove temperature on medium high and slowly heat the shells in the water. As soon as you see that little bubbles are starting to come up to the surface, reduce the heat to medium. Do not let it boil. You want to maintain the temperature at just below a simmer, where the bubbles just occasionally come up to the surface. Do not stir the shells. Stirring will muddy up the stock. As the bubbles come up to the surface a film of foam will develop on the surface. Use a large slotted spoon to skim away this foam. Let the shells cook like this for about an hour; skim the foam every few minutes. The foam comes from shells releasing impurities as their temperature increases.\n3 Put the thyme, bay leaves, and parsley in cheese cloth. Secure with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni.\n4 Once the stock has stopped releasing foam, you can add the wine, onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, herb bouquet garni, and peppercorns. Bring to a low simmer and reduce heat so that the stock continues to simmer, but not boil, for 30 minutes. If more foam comes to the surface, skim it off. Add salt and remove from heat.\n5 Dampen a few layers of cheesecloth and place over a large, fine mesh strainer, over a large pot or bowl. Pour the stock into the strainer. Discard the solids. Either use the stock right away, or cool for future use. If you aren't going to use in a couple of days, freeze (remember to leave some head room at the top of your freezer container for the liquid to expand as it freezes.)\nMakes 2-3 quarts. Reserve 4 cups for the crab bisque, refrigerate or freeze the rest.\nMaking the bisque\nNow on to the bisque...\n6 In a large, 4 or 6 quart saucepan, melt butter on medium heat, add the shallots and cook gently until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n7 Add the wine, stock, white rice, and tomato paste. Raise the heat and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to continue to simmer until rice is completely cooked, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for several minutes.\n8 Add about two thirds of the crab meat to the soup. Working in batches, ladle the soup into a blender and purée until completely smooth. Return puréed soup back to soup pan.\n9 Add cream and gently heat soup until it is hot enough for serving. Add the remaining one third of the crab meat. Add salt and cayenne pepper to taste (about ½ teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	During the winter months, our local Whole Foods gets one or two shipments in a week of freshly cooked Dungeness crab. Like all seafood, crab tastes best when it is as fresh as possible. When buying crab, ask the guy or gal behind the counter when they got the shipment in. The answer you want to hear is “this morning”. If the crab came in that morning, or even the day before, it should be good. If it is 3 or 4 days, I would wait until the next shipment. Make sure that you get a crab that is at least 2 lbs. If they don’t have any that big displayed, ask if they have any more in the back. Have them clean the crabs and crack them.\nTo make this creamy, flavorful crab bisque, you will need to make some homemade shellfish stock, so it pays to keep your leftover shells and freeze them until you have the occasion to make the stock. Making stock isn’t hard, like making chicken stock, it just takes time. You can freeze it in advance of using it.\n
576	How to Make Shellfish Stock	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Break thick shells (lobster and crab) into smaller pieces by putting in a sealed, thick plastic bag and either rolling with a rolling pin or hitting with a meat hammer to crush. Cut up thinner shrimp shells with a chef's knife. Don't crush or cut too small. You can even skip this step if you want, if you are already dealing with broken up shell pieces (like cracked crab). Place in a large roasting pan and roast at 400°F for 10 minutes (this step you can skip, but it greatly enhances the flavor).\nPut the shells in a large stock pot and add enough water to cover the shells with an inch of water.\n\n2 Put the stove temperature on medium high and slowly heat the shells in the water. As soon as you see that little bubbles are starting to come up to the surface, reduce the heat to medium. Do not let it boil. You want to maintain the temperature at just below a simmer, where the bubbles just occasionally come up to the surface. Do not stir the shells. Stirring will muddy up the stock. As the bubbles come up to the surface a film of foam will develop on the surface. Use a large slotted spoon to skim away this foam. Let the shells cook like this for about an hour; skim the foam every few minutes. The foam comes from shells releasing impurities as their temperature increases.\n3 Put the thyme, bay leaves, and parsley in cheese cloth. Secure with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni.\n4 Once the stock has stopped releasing foam, you can add the wine, onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, herb bouquet garni, and peppercorns. Bring to a low simmer and reduce heat so that the stock continues to simmer, but not boil, for 30 minutes. If more foam comes to the surface, skim it off. Add salt and remove from heat.\n\n5 Dampen a few layers of cheesecloth and place over a large, fine mesh strainer, over a large pot or bowl. Pour the stock into the strainer. Discard the solids. Either use the stock right away, or cool for future use. If you aren't going to use in a couple of days, freeze (remember to leave some head room at the top of your freezer container for the liquid to expand as it freezes.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Years ago, on a little island off the coast of Marblehead, Massachusetts, a friend’s aunt showed me how to eat a lobster, including the fine art of sucking the tender meat and juice out of the spindly legs. It was July, when lobsters are in season, and we had a huge pot of them for our gang. Aunt Judy then explained that one makes lobster bisque from the leftover shells. I still recall my astonishment. How could something so delicious come from boiled shells?\nWhile New England has its summer lobster season, we in Northern California have our winter Dungeness crab season. In anticipation of making stock for seafood bisques and stews, I have been collecting our leftover shells from each crab feast and freezing them. Making seafood stock is similar to making chicken stock; it takes time and attention, and the final result makes it worth the effort. Best to do on a weekend afternoon. Make a big batch and freeze what you don’t need.\n
577	Chocolate Pudding	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n1 Whisk together the sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt in a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Gradually whisk in the milk.  Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, and boil, whisking, until pudding is thick, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.\n\n\n\n2 Immediately beat the egg lightly in a medium, heat-proof bowl, such as a hard plastic or ceramic mixing bowl.  Very gradually add the hot chocolate mixture to the egg, whisking constantly.  Whisk in the chocolate chips until they are melted and the mixture is smooth.\n\n\n\n3 Pour the pudding into the ramekins or cups.  If you want, cover the surface of each of the pudding cups with some cut out wax paper to prevent a skin from forming on the top of the pudding.  Refrigerate, covered, until cold, at least 2 hours.\n\nOptional: Serve with whipped cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What to do on the last day of vacation with a kid who loves to help cook, a fridge stocked with whole milk and eggs, and a pantry with cocoa, chocolate chips and sugar? Make chocolate pudding, of course! Aldie and I shared a wickedly good afternoon making this batch, based off a recipe from The Gourmet Cookbook. Alden loves to help in the kitchen, not only with the cooking but with the cleaning up of the pots and pans as well. \n
584	Cod Fish Cakes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Boil and mash the potatoes, set them aside.  \n\n2 Boil the codfish until it flakes easkly.  Drain and flake the fish with a fork.  Be sure to remove all bones.  \n\n3 Mix the flaked fish, the potatoes and the rest of the ingredients together well by hand.  If the mixture is too crumbly, add another egg.  If too sticky, add some more bread crumbs.  \n\n4 Form the mixture into cakes and fry them on medium high heat in a skillet coated with oil, until nice browned on one side, then flip them over and continue to cook until well browned on the other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Preparation time: 40 minutes. Here is a delicious way to use up leftover fish or mashed potatoes. I made my first cod fish cakes after catching my first lingcod (which isn’t actually cod by the way, but it still worked fine).\n
578	Gingered Lemon Bars	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlden and Reilly1 Pre-bake the crust.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter.  Add 1/3 cup of sifted powdered sugar, and beat until light and fluffy.  Beat in half a teaspoon of the lemon zest, the ground ginger, the crystallized ginger, and a pinch of salt.  Add 1 1/2 cups of flour in batches, a 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition.  Continue to beat the crust batter until it is well combined.  \n\n2 Spread the crust batter evenly over the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish.  Bake at 350°F for 12 to 15 minutes, or until browned lightly around the edges.  \n\n3 While the crust is baking, whisk together the eggs, the lemon juice, the granulated sugar, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest, 3 Tbsp of flour, and the baking powder in a medium sized bowl.  Whisk until well blended.  \n\n4 Pour the lemon batter over the pre-baked crust.  Bake at 350°F for 15 to 20 minutes or until the top is golden.  If you want, sift a little additional powdered sugar over the top.  Let the lemon bars cool in the pan on a rack.  Cut it into 36 pieces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“I can’t wait for you to get here Elise. We can cook! We can make pies and cakes and cookies and more yummy things,” exclaimed my young friend Alden as we were talking on the phone last week. Between Easter, a Patriots Day parade and museum trips, we finally got a chance to do some baking. Reilly (8) and her sister Alden (6) helped me make scrumptious lemon bars that have candied ginger in the crust from a recipe in a 1987 issue of Gourmet magazine. I skipped the sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Don’t need that extra sugar. The lemon bars are great all on their own.\n
579	Citrus Pork with Egg Noodles	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet the water boiling for your noodles...\n\n1 In a small bowl combine cumin, salt and pepper.  Add pork; toss to coat.\n\n2 In a large skillet heat oil over medium hight heat.  Add the pork and garlic.  Sauté for 2 minutes or until browned.  \n\n3 In a small bowl blend the broth, orange juice, vinegar, and brown sugar.  Reserve 1/4 cup of the broth mixture.  Pour all but the reserved broth mixture into the skillet with the pork and garlic.  Add the carrots.  Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook 7-8 minutes.   \n\n4 Blend corn starch into reserved broth mixture.  Stirring constantly, pour the corn starch mixture into the skillet to thicken the sauce.  Add the green onions.   Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 more minute.  \n\n5 Toss with the noodles.  Serve immediately.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Under the headings of quick, easy, and a good way to stretch a half pound of pork, I present my friend Heidi’s Citrus Pork with Egg Noodles. I’ll admit that I was skeptical at first, but it’s surprisingly good and uses ingredients most of us can find all year round. Next time I think I’ll add a teaspoon of grated orange peel or some sliced kumquat for an added citrus edge.\n
580	Asparagus Frittata	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat butter into a 10-inch oven-proof frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add asparagus, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, covered, for 3 minutes.  \n\n2 Pour in eggs and cook until almost set, but still runny on top, about 2 minutes.  While cooking, pre-heat oven broiler.\n\n\n\n3 Sprinkle cheese over eggs and put in oven to broil until cheese is melted and browned, about 4-6 minutes.  Remove from oven with oven mitts and slide frittata onto a serving plate.  Cut into wedges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father got bit by the frittata bug this week and made these for us for lunch a few days ago. This is a quick and easy, no-nonsense recipe that makes a terrific frittata in hardly any time at all.\n
581	Roast Leg of Lamb	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place lamb and marinade into a plastic bag. Squeeze out as much of the air as possible from the bag and seal. Wrap again with another plastic bag to ensure that the marinating lamb doesn't leak. Marinate for several hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator. Remove the lamb, still in its marinade bag, from the refrigerator at least an hour (preferably two hours) before putting in the oven to help bring the lamb closer to room temperature before roasting.\n2 Preheat oven to 425°F. Arrange two racks in the oven - a middle rack to hold the lamb, and a lower rack to hold a roasting pan with which to catch the drippings.  Note that this arrangement of racks and pans, with the roast sitting directly on the oven rack, will create a natural convection of heat in the oven, causing the roast to cook more quickly than if cooked the traditional method in a rack in a roasting pan.\n\n3 Remove the lamb roast from its marinade bag (you may want to temporarily place lamb in another roasting pan, just to make it less messy to work with.) Pat dry the marinade off the lamb with paper towels. Generously salt and pepper all sides of the roast. Arrange the roast fattiest side up, so while the lamb is cooking the fat will melt into the meat. Insert an oven-proof meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, not touching the bone if your roast is bone-in. Place the roast directly on middle rack of the oven, with a roasting pan on a separate rack a rung lower, to catch the drippings. You may also want to put some water in the bottom roasting pan, so that the drippings fall into the water instead of burning in the hot pan and smoking up your kitchen.\n4 Roast at 425°F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 300°F and roast an additional 40 minutes (for a 6 pound boneless roast) to an hour (for a 6 pound bone-in roast).  If you are cooking a roast bone-in, the bone will act as an insulator and will require a longer cooking time than a boneless roast. In general estimate 10-13 minutes per pound for total cooking time (for rare), including that first 20 minutes at high heat. (Assuming you let the roast sit out for an hour or two before putting it in the oven. If it's right out of the fridge, it will take longer to cook.)\nNote that the method of cooking directly on the oven rack will mimic a convection oven and the cooking time/oven temp needed will be less than you would need if you cooked the roast on a rack in a roasting pan. If you are cooking the roast in a roasting pan, rack or not, start the roast at 450°F and then reduce the heat to 325°F. Also, the shape of the roast will have an impact on the cooking time. Our roast was rather long and thin, so it cooked up fairly quickly. A thicker roast may take longer than expected.\nSo, use a meat thermometer!\nAbout 20 minutes before you expect the roast to be done, start checking the meat thermometer. Note that every time you open the oven door, you'll need 10 minutes or so to bring the oven back up to temperature, thus slowing down the cooking process. So, don't check too often. Remove from the oven anywhere from 125°F to 135°F for medium rare. Lamb should never be cooked until well done or it will be too dry. Let stand for 25-30 minutes before carving. Cut away the kitchen string and slice with a sharp carving knife, 1/2 inch thick slices, against the grain of the meat.\n\n5 While the roast is resting, use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings in the roasting pan. Use the drippings to make a gravy, or use just the drippings themselves to serve with the lamb.\nServe with some homemade mint jelly for an added treat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The most important thing to remember about cooking a lamb roast is to not over-cook it. Lamb has such wonderful flavor on its own, and is so naturally tender, that it is bound to turn out well, as long as it is still a little pink inside. There is some debate over which method yields the best results – slow cooking at low heat the entire time, or searing first on high heat and then slow cooking. James Beard in his American Cookery prefers the slow-cook-low-heat method (he rubs the roast with salt and pepper and cooks it at 325°F the whole time.) We generally get great results with the searing method, starting at high heat and then dropping the temp which is the method described in the following recipe. If you use searing method, you will have ends that are more well done, and as you get closer to the interior, more rare. This way you have a variety to serve to guests.\n\nAnother point where there are wildly varying opinions is the internal temperature that constitutes “medium rare”. I’ve seen references that range from 120° to 145°F. For this roast, I pulled it out at 125°F. As it rested the internal temperature continued to rise a few points as the meat continued to cook. We like lamb on the rare side of medium rare, and this roast was perfectly done to our taste. Clearly an accurate meat thermometer is essential, and it helps to insert the meat thermometer at different places into the deep interior of the roast to get a good read.\n
582	Glazed Salmon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Place salmon fillets in a baking dish large enough to hold the salmon in one layer.\n\n2  In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cider and honey to a boil and let the mixture bubble steadily until it reduces by half.\n\n3  Pour the cider over the salmon, then let it sit for 10 minutes.\n\n4 Heat olive oil in a large skillet with a oven-proof handle on medium-high. Sprinkle the flesh side of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place the fish in the pan. Cook for 2 minutes, brushing the top with cider glaze so that the fish begins to caramelize.\n\n\n\n5 Turn the salmon fillets over and brush with the remaining cider glaze. Add the lemon halves to the skillet. Transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily when tested with the tip of a knife.  When you remove the skillet from the oven take special care with the very hot handle.  I tend to forget that the handle is hot once the skillet is back on the stove.  As a precaution I will melt an ice cube on the handle, or drape a hand towel on it.\n\n6 While the salmon is cooking, in another large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the spinach, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute, or just until the leaves begin to wilt. Pour the wine over them and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes more or until tender.7 To serve, drain any excess liquid from the spinach and divide it among 4 plates. Arrange a piece of salmon on top and garnish with a lemon half.\n\nServes four.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This simple but delicious salmon recipe comes via my friend Heidi in Carlisle, Massachusetts, who got it from the Boston Globe (Thanks Heidi!). Because there are so few ingredients, the recipe relies completely on the freshness of the ingredients. \n
585	Easy Shepherd’s Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Peel and quarter potatoes, boil in salted water until tender (about 20 minutes).\n2 While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 Tablespoons butter (1/2 a stick) in large frying pan.\n3 Sauté onions in butter until tender over medium heat (10 mins). If you are adding vegetables, add them according to cooking time. Put any carrots in with the onions. Add corn or peas either at the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat has initially cooked.\n\n4 Add ground beef and sauté until no longer pink. Add salt and pepper. Add worcesterchire sauce. Add half a cup of beef broth and cook, uncovered, over low heat for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth as necessary to keep moist.\n5 Mash potatoes in bowl with remainder of butter, season to taste.\n\n6 Place beef and onions in baking dish. Distribute mashed potatoes on top. Rough up with a fork so that there are peaks that will brown nicely. You can use the fork to make some designs in the potatoes as well.\n7 Cook in 400 degree oven until bubbling and brown (about 30 minutes). Broil for last few minutes if necessary to brown.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Shepherd’s Pie is originally an English dish, traditionally made with lamb or mutton. Americans typically make Shepherd’s Pie with beef, I think mostly because we are much more of a beef-eating culture than a lamb-eating one. The English (and Australians and New Zealanders) call the beef dish a “cottage pie”. Naming conventions aside, our American version of Shepherd’s Pie is essentially a casserole, lined with cooked meat and vegetables, topped with mashed potatoes, and baked.\nHere is a basic recipe for a simple ground beef Shepherd’s Pie. The original recipe comes from my friend Frances Hochschild and her mother (thanks Frannie!). We dressed it up a bit with some veggies and Worcestershire sauce.\n
586	Hummus	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a food processor, combine the garlic, garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, 1/2 cup water, and olive oil.  Process until smooth. Add salt, starting at a half a teaspoon, to taste.\n\n2 Spoon into serving dish and sprinkle with toasted pine nuts and chopped parsley.\n\nServe with crackers, raw dip vegetables such as carrots or celery, or with pita bread.  You can cut the pita bread into thin triangles, brush with olive oil and toast for 10 minutes in a 400°F oven to make pita chips with which to serve the hummus.\n\nMakes about 3 cups.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This basic hummus recipe calls for using canned garbanzo beans. I’ve made hummus using dried beans, soaking them, cooking them, etc. but the results just weren’t as good. The canned beans actually mash up pretty well.\n
587	Mom’s Chicken Enchiladas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\n2 Prepare the sauce.  Coat a large skillet with oil and sauté the onions on medium heat until translucent, a few minutes.  Add the garlic for a minute more. While the onions are cooking, purée the canned tomatoes in a blender.  Add the tomatoes to the onions and garlic.  Bring to a low simmer.  Start adding the chili powder, one teaspoon at a time, tasting after each addition, until you get to the desired level of heat and chili flavor.  For us that's around 2 Tablespoons.  But it depends on your taste and how strong the chili powder is that you are using.  Note that the tortillas and chicken will absorb some of the heat, so allow for that and let it be a little bit spicier than what you want in the finished dish.  Add a teaspoon of sugar if necessary to cut down on the acid from the tomatoes.  You want more of the taste of the chili and less of the tomatoes for this sauce.  As the sauce simmers, dilute it with water to keep it from getting too thick as it simmers.  Remove from heat.\n\nAlternatively, use a prepared canned enchilada sauce, which can be perfectly fine.\n\n3  Mix in 1/4 cup of the sauce with the cooked chicken, and a 1/4 cup of the cheese.  Sprinkle with a little salt.  Set aside.\n\n4  Prepare the tortillas.  There are 2 basic ways to prepare the tortillas - the traditional way of dipping them in the sauce and heating them individually, and my mom's way when she is trying to cut down on the fat.\n\n\nFirst the traditional way.  Heat a small light skillet on med-high heat.  Add a teaspoon of oil (high smoke point oil as indicated above, we use grapeseed oil) to coat the pan.  Dip a tortilla in the sauce to coat the tortilla with sauce on both sides.  Place the tortilla in the skillet and heat for a few seconds, until the tortilla begin to show some air bubbles.  Use a metal spatula to flip to the other side for a few more seconds.  Set aside on a plate.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.  Proceed to the step 5.\n\n\nFor my mom's low-fat method of heating up the tortillas, she places a small amount of oil in the skillet to coat the pan.  Add a tortilla, flip it to its other side.  Then add another tortilla on top of the first to soak up some of the excess oil.  Flip them both together and add yet another tortilla.  Keep adding them wherever there seems to be some excess oil.  The idea is to heat the tortillas and soften them with the minimum amount of oil.  As the tortillas become soft and heated, remove them to a paper towel to soak up even more excess oil.  If you find you need more oil in the pan, add it.  With this method, you do NOT get the chili flavor infused in the tortillas.  It is a matter of preference.  I prefer the first method, excess oil or not, because it has a much richer and spicier flavor.  But as my mom says, "Anything goes.  This is just a guideline; do what you want." \n\nNote that because we made this batch the low-fat way, the following photos show tortillas not coated in chili sauce, but the method is the same for if you did.\n\n\n\n5 Assemble the enchiladas.  Use an 8x12 inch pyrex baking dish. Place a couple spoonfuls of the chicken mixture in the center of a tortilla and roll it up.  Place in the baking dish and repeat until all dozen of your tortillas are neatly placed in rows in the casserole dish.  Cover the tortillas rolls with the remaining sauce.  Sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese.  Note that I recall often eating these chicken enchiladas with very little cheese on them.  Instead we had probably 2/3 cup of chopped fresh onion that had been soaked in vinegar sprinkled over the top.  (My mom, bless her soul, has no recollection of the chicken enchiladas without the sprinkled cheese.  But she's in her 70s and sometimes doesn't remember these things.  Or she remembers later and doesn't remember that she ever forgot them in the first place.  But heck, I'm in my 40s and my memory isn't what it used to be either.)\n\n6 Place in the oven and cook for 10 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.\n\nUse a metal spatula to serve.\n\nServe with thinly sliced iceberg lettuce that has been seasoned with vinegar and salt (no oil), guacamole or avocado slices, and sour cream. Garnish with cilantro.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Ninety-five percent of the time when we have enchiladas, it is my mom’s (amazingly good, incredibly awesome) cheese enchiladas. Once in a while however, she’ll make chicken enchiladas. With chicken enchiladas she often uses a red chili sauce which is spicier than the green chiles of the cheese enchiladas. Sometimes she uses canned enchiladas sauce, sometimes she makes it from scratch. Sometimes she coats the tortillas in sauce before cooking them, sometimes she doesn’t. Every time she cooks it is an improvisation, so it can be difficult to pin her down on any one method or another. I’ve presented here her basic methods, with the variations. \n
588	Strawberry White Chocolate Mousse	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Clean and hull the strawberries.  Starting with about half of the strawberries (3/4 pound), quarter them and purée them in either a blender or food processor.  Then press the purée mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl.  You want to end up with 1 cup of purée.  Stir in 1 Tbsp of the lemon juice and set aside.  With the remaining 3/4 pound or so of berries, slice as many as to fill up 2 cups, and set aside.2 Melt white chocolate in a double boiler, or a stainless steel bowl set over simmering water (make sure the simmering water doesn't actually touch the bottom of the bowl.)  Stir until smooth, set aside.3 Put ¼ cup of cool water into a small bowl.  Sprinkle the gelatin powder over the water and let sit for 5 minutes.\n\n4 Stir ¼ cup of the cream and the 2 Tbsp of powdered sugar in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Add the gelatin mixture and stir until the gelatin has dissolved.  Pour into the bowl of melted chocolate, and stir until smooth.  Whisk in 3/4 cup of the strawberry purée.  Reserve the remaining  ¼ cup of purée.\n\n5 Using an electric mixer, whip the remaining 1 3/4 cup of cream.  (Note I usually use a blender to whip cream, but in this case an electric mixer or hand beater is preferred, you have better control over the amount of whipping.) Beat on medium-high speed until medium peaks form.  Whisk one third of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.  Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold the remaining whipped cream into the mixture.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.\n\n6  Stir the remaining 1 Tbsp of lemon juice into the reserved sliced berries.  Fold the sliced berries into the mousse.  Spoon mousse into serving cups and refrigerate for at least another hour, preferably several hours, or even over night (cover with plastic wrap).\n\n7 When you are read to serve the mousse, pour a dollop of the reserved strawberry purée onto each serving.  Add a few slices of strawberries as garnish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We recently came across an intriguing recipe for strawberry mousse cake in Martha Stewart Living and decided to skip the cake part and just make the strawberry white chocolate mousse. It was fabulously cool and rich, just the dessert for a warm spring evening. The following recipe is modified slightly. I found we didn’t need as many strawberries as the magazine’s recipe suggested. Also, we served the mousse with some remaining strawberry purée on top. The purée is not sweetened and adds a lovely mildly tart balance to the rich mousse.\n
589	Three Bean Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large bowl, mix the 3 different types of beans, the celery, onion (drained of soaking water), parsley, and rosemary.\n2 In a separate small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add the dressing to the beans. Toss to coat.\n3 Chill beans in the refrigerator for several hours, to allow the beans to soak up the flavor of the dressing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	3-bean salad is one of those quintessential American summer picnic foods. It’s comforting, protein-rich, and easy to put together quickly with pantry ingredients. 3-bean salad is usually made with canned green beans instead of the cannellini white beans I’m using here. But I’ve yet to meet a canned green bean I like, so cannellini it is.\nThis bean salad is traditionally dressed with a sweet and sour dressing made with vinegar, oil, and sugar. You can cut back the sugar if you want, but I wouldn’t cut it out completely, or the dressing will be too acidic.\n
590	Pot Roast	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Use a thick-bottomed covered pot (oven-proof if you intend to cook in oven), such as a dutch oven, just large enough to hold roast and vegetables. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil on medium high heat (hot enough to sear the meat). Pat the roast dry with paper towels. Sprinkle and rub salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning all over the meat. Brown roast in pot, all over, several minutes on each side. Don't move the roast while a side is browning, or it won't brown well.\n\n2 When roast is browned, remove from pan and set on a plate. Add the onions to the pan and cook for about 5 to 10 minutes, until they begin to brown. Add the garlic and carrots to sit on top of the onions. Set the roast on top of the onions, garlic and carrots. Add 1/2 cup of red wine. Add the bay leaf. Cover. Bring to simmer and then adjust the heat down to the lowest heat possible to maintain a low simmer when covered (we cook our roast on the warm setting of our electric range)*. (If cooking in the oven, bring to a simmer first on the stovetop, then put in the oven, start the temp at 300°F for 15 minutes, then drop it to 250°F for the first hour, then 225° after that.)\n3 Cook for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours, or longer, until meat is tender. (If you are using a pressure cooker, cut the time by half).\nAfter cooking 3 1/2 hours. Note how much liquid has been released by the meat. This comes from slow cooking at a very low temperature. If your pot roast is too dry, make sure the pan you are using has a tight fitting lid and that you are cooking at the lowest possible heat to maintain the low simmering.\nSuggest serving with green beans and potatoes\n*If you use a gas range, you may find difficulty getting the flame low enough. A tip I recently read in Cook's Illustrated suggests tightly rolling up some aluminum foil, shaping it into a skinny donut, and putting that on top of the burner to create a little more distance between the range and the pan. If you have one of those high BTU ranges, I recommend cooking the roast in the oven instead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Pot roast was a standard growing up, and still continues to be in my parent’s household. It requires slow cooking over low heat to ensure tender, flavorful meat. Pot roasts typically use the tougher cuts of beef – a chuck roast or shoulder roast – which have the most flavor. The slow cooking at low heat is what melts the tough connective tissue between the muscle fibers, leaving you with tender meat that flakes apart with your fork. This is my mother’s tried and true recipe for pot roast. She only adds a half cup of liquid to the pot because she’s able to keep the heat very low and her pot has a tight cover.\n
837	Herb Marinated Braised Lamb Shanks	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Stir together in a small bowl the ground cumin, coriander, thyme, rosemary, curry powder, and salt. Mix in 1/4 cup olive  oil. Place lamb shanks in large freezer bag.  Add the spice oil to the bag. Rub spice oil all over shanks. Press the air out of the bag and seal the bag.  Place in a dish to catch any leakage. Marinate 4 hours or overnight.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over high heat. Remove lamb shanks from marinade bag and place in heated pan. Discard remaining marinade.  Cook lamb shanks until brown on all sides, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add stock and garlic; bring to boil, cover and transfer to oven. Cook 1 hour; remove from oven and turn lamb shanks over. Cover and continue cooking until lamb is tender, about 45 minutes longer. \n\n\nUsing tongs, transfer lamb to platter; tent with foil to keep warm.\n\n\n\n3 Bring liquid in pot to simmer over medium heat. Add carrots; simmer 10 minutes. Add potatoes to liquid and simmer 5 minutes longer. Add tomatoes and zucchini to liquid and simmer until vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to platter with lamb.  Spoon off fat from braising liquid, reserving 1 tablespoon. \n\n  \n\n4 Heat reserved fat in heavy large skillet over medium heat. (If there is no fat, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil instead.)  Whisk in flour; stir 2 minutes. Whisk in tomato paste and 1 cup of the braising liquid. Add back into the pot with the rest of the braising liquid.  Boil for a couple minutes until slightly thickened.  Add back the vegetables and the lamb shanks.  If you want, use a couple forks to break away the lamb meat from the bones.  Discard the bones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What is it about September that the minute it’s no longer oppressively hot we can’t wait to make a slow-cooked, braised stew? Perhaps it was that these lamb shanks had been sitting in our large freezer all summer long, and every time I opened it (usually to get out the ice cream maker bowl) there they were, just asking to be cooked. Finally it has cooled down enough that we can enjoy a hearty stew. Lamb shanks come from either the forelegs or the lower hind legs of a lamb, which get a lot of exercise, and therefore are great cuts for stews and slow-cooked braises. The long cooking time is needed to break down the tough connective tissue in the muscles. At the end of cooking the meat should just fall off the bone. With the addition of fresh tomatoes and zucchini, this herb-marinated lamb stew is a great dish for the end of summer and beginning of fall.\n
591	Strawberry Rhubarb Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix the rhubarb and the strawberries with the sugar, tapioca, salt, and orange rind.  Let sit for 10 minutes.  \n\n \n\n2 Turn into a pastry lined pan.  Top with the pastry, trim the edge, and crimp the top and bottom edges together.  Cut slits in the top for the steam to escape.\n\n\n\n3 Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes, reduce heat to 350°F, and bake an additional 30-40 minutes longer (40 to 50 minutes longer if doing a 10-inch pie).  Cool on a rack.  \n\nServe warm or cold.  If you do cool to room temperature, the juices will have more time to thicken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Rhubarb is one of those strange vegetables that acts more like a fruit – the bright pink rhubarb stems that is; the leaves are poisonous. Strawberry rhubarb pie is one of my favorite pies in the world; in fact everyone here loves it. I made this pie for a party and had to make another the next day for my parents, who had heard me talk about it and couldn’t believe I hadn’t brought them a piece. We ended up making 3 pies this last week, one using a James Beard recipe, another a Best Recipe recipe, and the third what we thought ended up being the best combination. It’s a little bit tricky because depending on how sweet your strawberries are, you’ll need more or less sugar. We found the ratio of 3 to 1, rhubarb to strawberries, yielded the most flavorful results.\n
592	Salmon Spread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Poach salmon fillet by heating 1/2 inch of water in a skillet to boiling.  Add salmon fillet; reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. Carefully remove salmon from water with a slotted spatula or spoon; drain salmon on paper towels. Transfer salmon to medium bowl; cool slightly.\n\n2 With wooden spoon, stir and mash poached salmon until it almost becomes a smooth paste. Add smoked salmon, butter, Dijon mustard, capers, pepper, lemon peel, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons chopped chives; mix thoroughly.\n\n3 Spoon salmon mixture into a serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving or until soft enough to spread. Sprinkle with remaining chopped chives and serve with sliced French baguette, toasted or plain.\n\nMakes about 3 cups of spread, so depending on how thinly or thickly you put it on baguette slices, you could have 20-50 servings.  For a lower-carb version, spread over slices of cucumber.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of the tastiest appetizers you can prepare for a gathering is a simple salmon spread. Usually salmon spreads are little more than smoked salmon mixed with cream cheese. This spread uses a combination of smoked salmon and freshly poached salmon, mixed together with lemon juice, capers, Dijon, chives, lemon zest, and butter. It’s absolutely delicious on toasted baguette slices.\n
593	Dee’s Oatmeal Pancakes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put oats into a large bowl, add the buttermilk. Let the oats soak in the buttermilk overnight.\n2 Mix in the eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, and peanut oil.\n\n3 Then proceed as with any pancake recipe. Heat a flat iron surface - griddle or large pan - to medium high heat. Oil the pan with either a Tbsp of butter or vegetable oil. Ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle to the desired size, usually about 5 or 6 inches wide. When air bubbles start to bubble up to the surface at the center of the pancakes (about 2-3 minutes), use a flat spatula to flip them over. After a minute, peek under one for doneness. When golden or darker golden brown, they are done. Note that cooking the second side takes only about half as long as the first side. And the second side doesn't brown as evenly as the first side. Serve immediately or keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.\nServe with butter, maple syrup, and macerated strawberries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Do you love oatmeal? Do you love pancakes? You should try them when they are one and the same. Seriously. Dee Johnston whipped up her favorite family recipe for a recent gathering of friends and this is now my new favorite pancake. Great smothered with butter and maple syrup (of course) and also leftover strawberries from strawberry shortcake. A little advanced planning is necessary as the oats must soak in buttermilk overnight. Yummmmm….\n
594	Sautéed Swiss Chard Ribs with Cream and Pasta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Separate the ribs from the greens. Cut the ribs into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces.  Blanch the ribs in lightly salted boiling water for 3 minutes.\n\n\n\n2 Melt butter in a saucepan on medium heat.  Add the drained, blanched ribs and simmer for 4 minutes.  Add heavy cream and cook until cream reduces by two-thirds.\n\n3 While the cream is reducing, cook up your pasta according to the pasta's package directions.\n\n4 Mix creamed chard with pasta.  Season lightly with salt and freshly ground pepper.\n\nServes four.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The Swiss chard I planted last spring survived the winter to vigorously return this year. Last week we made a yogurt dip with the leaves of some swiss chard I picked. The ribs from that bunch went into this dish, which was so good we ate it up before I could get a photo. The basic recipe for the chard comes from The Victory Garden Cookbook. Just straight with the cream and butter, the chard is too rich, but mixed in with pasta (we used rice penne pasta) it is superb.\n
595	Swiss Chard Tzatziki (Yogurt Dip)	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Bring a 1 or 2 quart saucepan, half filled with water, to a boil.  Add the chopped chard leaves.  Cook until tender, about 3-5 minutes.  While the chard is cooking, prepare a bowl with ice water for an ice bath.   When the chard is cooked, strain through a fine mesh strainer and put into the ice bath to stop the cooking.  Drain and set aside.\n\n2 Using mortar and pestle, grind the garlic and salt into a paste.  In a medium-sized bowl, stir in the yogurt, chard, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper.  Set aside.\n\n3 Cut the pita bread into triangles and layout in one layer in a broiling pan (use a sturdy broiling pan, not a cookie sheet or your cookie sheet will warp).  Drizzle olive oil on one side of the pita wedges.  Use a pastry brush to spread the olive oil more evenly.  Place in a broiler.  Broil for 5 minutes or until the pita bread starts to toast.  Remove and let cool for a minute.\n\nServe the tzatziki with the pita wedges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tzatziki is a Greek dip made with yogurt, olive oil, garlic, and cucumbers. This version (from Martha Stewart Living) replaces the cucumbers with Swiss chard and is delightful with toasted pita. Dad announced a couple weeks ago that he didn’t like chard (my response – huh? since when?) and then proceeded to eat most of the tzatziki. \n
602	Berry and Banana Terrine	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  In  a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup grape juice; let soften 2 to 3 minutes.\n\n2  Heat sugar with another 1/4 cup grape juice in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until dissolved.  Remove from heat; stir in softened gelatin until dissolved, then stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups grape juice.\n\n3  Place berries in a 4-by-8-inch (6 cup capacity) loaf pan; pour gelatin mixture over, pressing berries gently to submerge completely (remove a few berries if necessary.)  Refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours.\n\n4  To unmold, dip bottom of pan in hot water about 5 seconds.  Invert onto a serving platter, and shake firmly to relase.  Slice to serve.\n\nServe with whipped cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This berry and banana terrine is an easy and beautiful way to serve summer berries with bananas for added sweetness. Think Jello but packed with fruit. And instead of neon artificial colored Jello, you use unflavored gelatin with white grape juice – a healthier, prettier, and tastier alternative. \n
596	Lamb Stew with Almonds and Apricots	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a bowl combine the ginger, pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, cayenne, coriander, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves and water and mix well. Add the meat and rub in the paste, coating evenly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\n\n2 In a Dutch oven or other heavy, lidded pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, and cinnamon sticks and cook until the onions are translucent and the mixture is fragrant.\n\n\n\n3 Add the marinated meat (including the marinade) to the pot and then the chicken stock. Bring the stock to a boil, and skim off any scum that appears.\n\n4 Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring from time to time. Add water if the pot becomes too dry.  Stew until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours, more if needed.\n\n5 Add the apricots, almonds, honey, and carrots and simmer, uncovered, stirring often to prevent scorching, until the meat is very soft and almost falling apart, about 30 minutes longer. The sauce should reduce to a syrupy glaze.  At this point taste and add lemon juice to desired level.  The lemon juice brings some balance to the sweetness from the honey and apricots.\n\nNote: this recipe can be prepared in advance up to this point. Allow to cool, refrigerate and serve within a couple of days.\n\n6 Stir in the chopped parsley and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Serve immediately with couscous or rice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Following this recipe from the NY Times the other day, I made a sweet lamb stew with honey, almonds, and apricots. The stew is a traditional lamb tagine called Mrouzia, prepared throughout North Africa during Ramadan. I had several problems with the NY Times recipe, the first being that although the recipe calls for 3 lbs of lamb, if you look at the video instructions on the NY Times site, the chef is clearly using at least 4 lbs of lamb and is using 6 cups of stock to go with it. I used only 2 lbs of lamb, reduced the stock required by a third, and it still took way too long to reduce to the proper consistency. The stew is also very sweet. Apparently a Mrouzia uses a lot of honey as a way to help preserve the meat in places without refrigeration. But, that’s not a problem here, and all that honey just makes it seem unbalanced. Finally, I messed up and used regular whole raw almonds instead of blanched almonds (without skins). I don’t think it makes much of a difference, but every recipe I checked calls for blanched almonds.\nThe stew was actually terrific, especially after I balanced the sweetness a little with some fresh squeezed lemon juice. It is highly flavorful and very rich. What follows are the proportions of ingredients that I would use the next time I make this stew – less stock, a lot less honey and a little lemon to balance the sweetness.\n
597	Enchiladas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n\n2 In a large fry pan at medium-high heat add 3 Tbsp of grapeseed oil.  Add a tortilla to the pan.  Cook for 2-3 seconds, lift up the tortilla with a spatula, add another tortilla underneath.  Cook for 2-3 seconds, lift again, both tortillas, and add another tortilla underneath.  Repeat the process with all the tortillas, adding a little more oil if needed.  This way you can brown and soften the tortillas without using a lot of fat.  You do this process to develop the flavor of the tortillas.  As the tortillas brown a little, remove from the pan one by one to rest on a paper towel, which absorbs any excess fat.\n\n2 Sauté up the chopped onion and garlic, then turn off the heat.  Add 1 cup of salsa.  Dissolve 3 Tbsp of tomato paste into 1 cup of water, add to pan.  Add 1 cup of crushed fire roasted canned tomatoes.  Taste.  If the sauce tastes too vinegary, add a teaspoon of sugar.\n\n3 Put some olive oil on the bottom of a large casserole pan.  Take a tortilla, cover 2/3 of it lightly with the shredded cheese, then roll up the tortilla and place it in the casserole pan.  Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled.  Add sauce to the top of the tortillas in the the casserole pan.  Make sure all are covered with the sauce.  If not, add a little water.  Cover the whole thing with the rest of the grated cheese.  Put the casserole in the oven for 10 minutes or until the cheese melts.\n\n4 Garnish with cilantro and sour cream.  Serve with sliced iceberg lettuce that has been dressed only with vinegar and salt.  See Perfect Guacamole for a great guacamole avocado side dish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Enchiladas were a family staple growing up, though thankfully this cheese enchilada recipe has much less fat in it these days. My mother, a fifth generation hispanic Arizonian, learned this recipe from my grandmother. Note that there are many kinds of enchiladas – green chile, shrimp, chicken, red chili – to name a few. This recipe is much more “Tex Mex” than Mexican, and is very easy make. This enchiladas recipe is probably our favorite recipe on the entire website.\n
598	Quesadilla	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large cast iron frying pan to medium high heat.  Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2 teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you could use butter as well).   Take one large flour tortilla and place it in the pan.  Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips.  Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla. \n\n\n\n2 When pockets of air begin to form, take a handful of grated cheese, sprinkle over the top of the tortilla, making sure that the cheese does not land on the pan itself.  Add whatever additional ingredients you choose - green onion, sliced mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc.  If you would like your quesadilla to be a chicken quesadilla, add some diced cooked chicken.  Take care not to layer on the ingredients to thickly - this is a quesadilla, not a quiche.  \n\n\n\n3 Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan.  The cast iron pan should be hot enough by now to have plenty of residual heat to melt the cheese and brown the tortilla.  If the quesadilla begins to smoke too much, remove from the heat.  After a minute, check to see if the cheese is melted.  If not, return the cover and keep checking every minute until the cheese is melted.  When the cheese is sufficiently melted, use a spatula to lift up one side of the quesadilla and flip over the other side, as if you were making an omelette.  The tortilla should by now be browned slightly.  If it is not browned, turn the heat up to high and flip the quesadilla over every 10 seconds or so until it gets browned.  Remove from pan and cut into wedges.\n\nTo make the lettuce to accompany the quesadilla, thinly slice some iceberg lettuce.  Sprinkle some cider vinegar on it and some salt.\n\nServe with the lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I grew up making quesadillas, the benefit of having a Hispanic mother who is a great cook. “Queso” is cheese in Spanish. And a quesadilla is a toasted tortilla with melted cheese inside. But in addition to cheese, you can put practically anything in a quesadilla. My favorites are mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, and onions. I don’t cook these ingredients first, but it really is a matter of taste. You could if you wanted to.\n
599	Scalloped Turnips	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Butter a 1-quart casserole.  Melt 1 Tbsp butter and lightly sauté onions until just wilted.  \n\n2 Layer a third of the sliced turnips in the casserole dish; top with a third of the onion;  sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of flour, 1/3 teaspoon of salt, and one grind of pepper; pat with dollops from 1 tablespoon of butter.  Repeat this layering twice.\n\n3 Mix milk and cream together and pour over the turnips.  Cover and bake in a 350°F oven for 30 minutes, then remove cover and bake for another 30-45 minutes, or until tender and bubbly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Okay, so not everyone loves turnips as much as we do. But even if you aren’t the biggest fan of that radishy root, this recipe might just turn you around. Not surprisingly, cream, butter and onions bring out the savory best in turnips. Recipe is adapted from one of my favorite veggie cookbooks – The Victory Garden Cookbook.\n
600	Sauteed Baby Artichokes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Rinse the baby artichokes.  Set out a bowl with 3 cups of ice-cold water; add the fresh squeezed juice from 2 lemons (about  3 Tbsp of lemon juice) or vinegar.  Working on the artichokes one by one, cut off the stem to 1/4-inch from the base; peel back and remove the petals until only the top third of the cone tip is pale green green.  Cut off the pale green tips.  Trim off any remaining green from base of artichoke.  Halve or quarter the artichokes, depending on their size and drop in the bowl of acidified water (to prevent discoloration).\n\n2 Drain artichokes.  In a large skillet, heat the artichokes and 1 cup of water to boiling.  Cover and simmer 3-5 minutes, depending on the size of the artichokes.  Drain well.\n\n\n\n3 Using the same skillet, heat to medium high and add the olive oil.  Add the artichokes, onions, garlic, and herbes de Provence.  Cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally.  Sprinkle on 1 Tbsp lemon juice or vinegar, salt and pepper.  Put in serving bowl, sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	For years I’ve walked by those packages of baby artichokes at Trader Joe’s not willing to try them because they just didn’t seem worth the effort. I’m glad to report that I was completely wrong. They actually take less time to prepare than regular artichokes because they cook up in only a few minutes versus 40 minutes for globe artichokes. According to Amy of Cooking with Amy (one of my favorite food bloggers), baby artichokes aren’t not fully grown artichokes at all, just a variety of chokes that mature in a smaller size. The benefit of using these small artichokes is that once you peel off the outer green layers of petals, the entire rest of the artichoke is edible, as the fuzzy choke part has not really developed. You can also simmer the discarded leaves in water for an hour to make an artichoke vegetable stock for soup, so nothing goes to waste. Artichokes pair well with something acidic, such as lemon or balsamic vinegar, and something creamy, such as mayonnaise or Parmesan cheese. These sautéed baby artichokes are easy to prepare and combine flavors that work naturally well with artichokes. They can be eaten alone, or mixed in with pasta or risotto, or baked on to pizza.\n
601	Strawberry Cream Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBake the cake1 Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position.  Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease and flour round 9 by 2-inch cake pan or 9-inch springform pan and line with parchment paper.  In a large bowl, by hand, whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and all but 3 Tbsp of the sugar in mixing bowl. Whisk in 2 whole eggs and 3 yolks (reserving whites), butter, water, and vanilla.  Whisk until smooth.\n\n2 Using a mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat remaining 3 egg whites at medium-low speed until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. With machine running, gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir one-third of whites into batter to lighten.  Add the remaining whites and gently fold into batter until no white streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes, then invert cake onto greased wire rack; peel off and discard parchment. Invert cake again; cool completely, about 2 hours.\n\nStrawberry filling3 Cut in half 24 of best-looking berries and reserve. Slice or quarter remaining berries; toss with 4 to 6 tablespoons sugar (depending on sweetness of berries) in medium bowl and let sit 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  The sugar will macerate the strawberries, making them soft, and generating liquid. Strain the juices from berries and reserve (you should have about 1/2 cup).   Put the strawberries in a bowl and use a potato masher to mash them; set aside.\n\nIn small saucepan over medium-high heat, simmer reserved juices until syrupy and reduced to about 3 tablespoons, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour reduced syrup over macerated berries, add pinch of salt, and toss to combine. Set aside until cake is cooled.\n\nWhipped cream4 When cake has cooled, place cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and salt in bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment. Whisk at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Reduce speed to low and add heavy cream in slow, steady stream; when almost fully combined, increase speed to medium-high and beat until mixture holds stiff peaks, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes more, scraping bowl as needed (you should have about 4 1/2 cups).\n\nAssemble the cake5 Using large serrated knife, slice cake into three even layers. Place bottom layer on cardboard round or cake plate and arrange ring of 12-20 strawberry halves, cut sides down and stem ends facing out, around perimeter of cake layer. Pour one half of puréed berry mixture (about 3/4 cup) in center, then spread to cover any exposed cake. Gently spread about one-third of whipped cream (about 1 1/2 cups) over berry layer, leaving 1/2-inch border from edge. Place middle cake layer on top and press down gently (whipped cream layer should become flush with cake edge). Repeat with 12-20 additional strawberry halves, remaining berry mixture, and half of remaining whipped cream; gently press last cake layer on top. Spread remaining whipped cream over top; decorate with remaining cut strawberries. \n\nServe immediately, or keep chilled.  If the whipped cream warms to room temperature it will be harder to keep stable while cutting.  Serves 8 to 10.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father has been looking for an excuse to make this cake since he first saw it in Cook’s Illustrated (May/June 2006). With dual imperatives of Mother’s Day being two weeks away and my brother John’s birthday (never mind that John lives in Oklahoma and we live in California) dad finally had the motivation he needed. Cook’s Illustrated mentions in its write-up that this is a “special occasion” cake, and indeed it is. The cake is much more involved than our usual strawberry shortcake, but perhaps more suited to a formal occasion. In the following, our adapted recipe, we omit the 2 Tbsp of Kirsch from the strawberry purée, and we mash the strawberries with a potato masher instead of using a food processor.\n
603	Grapefruit Avocado Salad with Plum Mayo Dressing	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArrange slices of avocados and grapefruit segments on a plate, either on lettuce or not.  In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise together with jam and lemon juice, taste test for the balance between the sweet of the jam and the sour of the lemon and make any adjustments needed.  Spoon dressing over salad.  Salt and pepper to taste.\n\nThe hardest part of making the salad is segmenting the grapefruit.  Helen of Beyond Salmon shows in detail the steps to segment an orange which is almost identical to how I segment grapefruit.  Grapefruit are somewhat bigger than oranges.  After getting the peel off, I cut them in half along the line of a membrane and then just work with half a grapefruit at a time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Grapefruit and avocado are one of those natural food pairings, like lamb and mint, or dark chocolate and raspberries. They just taste good together. They are perfect for a summer salad when avocados are relatively cheap and the grapefruit from our tree are finally ripe. My mother uses homemade plum jam to make a sweet mayo dressing for this simple salad. We usually serve it on some lettuce, but I forgot to this time, and it isn’t really necessary.\n
604	Arugula, Mozzarella, Tomato on Focaccia	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 In a large bowl or baking dish combine tomatoes, onion, and vinegar and season with pepper and salt. Marinate 30 minutes.\n2 Layer mozzarella, tomatoes, onions and arugula on the focaccia half. Spread some mayonnaise on the top half of the focaccia if desired. Press top half over the bottom, hold together with a couple of tooth picks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“You don’t have enough sandwiches on your blog,” my father declared a few days ago. “Wadaya mean I don’t have enough sandwiches? I’ve got plenty of sandwiches,” said I. Dad proceeded to rattle off a list of sandwiches he likes that he couldn’t find on the site, ending with, “and you don’t even have the arugula focaccia sandwich!” as if given how much arugula we grow around here the very omission was a sin of the highest order. “Can’t do anything about that dad, arugula is out of season.” A little while later my father went out and returned with some freshly baked focaccia bread, tomatoes, mozzarella, and a bunch of arugula he foraged from Whole Foods. The pain of spending $2.50 on a handful of arugula that grows like weeds half the year in our garden was not lost on him, or me for that matter. “Oh, the sacrifices I make for your site,” he joked, adding, “Tell your readers they can substitute watercress if they can’t find arugula.” And there you have it.\n
605	French Vanilla Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1   In a medium bowl, beat together the yolks and half of the sugar.  You can beat by hand using a whisk or using a hand mixer or egg beater.  Beat until thoroughly smooth and creamy. (A couple of minutes by hand.)\n\n\n\n2 Put cream, 1 cup of the milk, the remaining half of the sugar, and the salt into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Scrape vanilla seeds from beans with the tip of a small knife into pan; add beans. Heat the mixture until just before it starts to simmer (do not let simmer). Remove mixture from heat and let stand 10 minutes.\n\n3 While the mixture is standing, prepare an ice water bath in a bowl large enough to set another bowl easily inside of it.  Set aside.\n\n4   Whisk in 1 cup of the cream mixture in a slow stream into the yolk mixture to temper it. Add another cup of the cream mixture; continue to whisk. Transfer the egg yolk mixture back to the saucepan with the remaining cream, milk and vanilla.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon and an instant-read thermometer registers 180°, 5 to 7 minutes.  (You can run your finger in a line over the back of the coated spoon.  If the mixture doesn't run, but stays in place on the spoon, it should be thick enough.)  Remove from heat and mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of milk to stop the mixture from overcooking.\n\n5   Pour custard through a medium-mesh sieve into a stainless steel bowl set in the ice-water bath. Let cool completely, stirring until completely chilled.6   Freeze custard in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. (Take care not to over churn the ice cream or it will get a grainy texture.) If you serve the ice cream immediately, it will probably be pretty soft.  Freeze it for at least an hour in an airtight plastic container to have a firmer texture.  If it has been frozen for more than a day, you may need to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften before serving it.\n\nServe with caramel sauce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Years ago I remember my father making vanilla ice cream for all of us with an ice cream maker that required a lot of crushed ice and salt. Can’t remember now if it was hand crank or electric. But man oh man was that ice cream good – so rich and creamy. The ice cream makers have improved a lot in the last thirty years, no more need for crushed ice or salt, just have to remember to put the bowl in the freezer a day ahead of time. We recently bought a new ice cream maker and to break it in we made a batch of French vanilla ice cream – the kind with egg yolks and vanilla been seeds in it. French vanilla is a bit more complicated than regular vanilla or most of the ice cream recipes that come with the machine, as you need to prepare a custard mix by cooking the eggs and cream first. But unlike many homemade ice creams which can be a little on the ice-y side, because of the added richness of the egg yolks, French vanilla stays creamier – at least for the first day or two in the freezer. Actually, I don’t think this batch lasted past day two, it was just too good to let languish in the freezer.\n
606	Caramel Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 First, before you begin, make sure you have everything ready to go - the cream and the butter next to the pan, ready to put in.  Making caramel is a fast process that cannot wait for hunting around for ingredients.  If you don't work fast, the sugar will burn.  Safety first - make sure there are no children under foot and you may want to wear oven mitts; the caramelized sugar will be much hotter than boiling water.\n\n\n\n2  Heat sugar on moderately high heat in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart or 3-quart saucepan.  As the sugar begins to melt, stir vigorously with a whisk or wooden spoon.  As soon as the sugar comes to a boil, stop stirring.  You can swirl the pan a bit if you want, from this point on. Note that this recipe works best if you are using a thick-bottomed pan.  If you find that you end up burning some of the sugar before the rest of it is melted, the next time you attempt it, add a half cup of water to the sugar at the beginning of the process, this will help the sugar to cook more evenly, though it will take longer as the water will need to evaporate before the sugar will caramelize.\n\n\n\n3 As soon as all of the sugar crystals have melted (the liquid sugar should be dark amber in color), immediately add the butter to the pan.  Whisk until the butter has melted.\n\n\n\n4 Once the butter has melted, take the pan off the heat.  Count to three, then slowly add the cream to the pan and continue to whisk to incorporate.  Note than when you add the butter and the cream, the mixture will foam up considerably.  This is why you must use a pan that is at least 2-quarts (preferably 3-quarts) big.\n\n5 Whisk until caramel sauce is smooth.  Let cool in the pan for a couple minutes, then pour into a glass mason jar and let sit to cool to room temperature.  (Remember to use pot holders when handling the jar filled with hot caramel sauce.) Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.  Warm before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Making your own caramel sauce from scratch is a lot easier than you might think, and it takes practically no time at all. This recipe comes from my friend Suzanne who is a baking genius. I’ve watched her make caramel sauce many times and finally got around to doing it myself. My one note of caution is to be extra careful while you are cooking the sugar, as with any candy making process. Once the sugar has melted it has a much higher temperature than boiling water. Also, when you add the cream, the mixture will foam up, so use a pan with high sides.\n
607	Mushroom Caviar	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Melt butter in a large skillet on high heat.  Add the mushrooms and shallots.  Sauté for 5 minutes stirring frequently.\n\n2 While the mushrooms are cooking, heat a small skillet on high heat.  Add the pine nuts.  Cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to get a little toasted.  (Keep your eyes on the nuts, they can burn pretty quickly.) As soon as they begin to toast, remove the pan from the heat and put the pine nuts into a small bowl.  Set aside.\n\n3 While the mushrooms are cooking, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Once they have cooked for about 5 minutes, add the garlic and a tablespoon of dry white wine.  Cook for an additional minute and remove from heat.  Put mushroom mixture in a bowl, add the toasted pine nuts, and set aside to cool.\n\n4 Once the mushrooms have cooled down a bit, mix in the lemon juice, sour cream, and parsley.  Add more salt and pepper, if needed, to taste.  Sprinkle on cayenne pepper, to taste.  Chill before serving.\n\nSpoon onto a large butter lettuce leaf and serve with crackers.  (Use rice crackers for gluten-free option.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Whoever came up with the term “mushroom caviar” must have been in marketing. Mushroom caviar just sounds so much more catchy than “mushroom spread” or “minced mushrooms and shallots sautéed in butter”, even though that’s basically what it is. Pretty good too, especially if you love mushrooms the way we do.\n
912	Red Velvet Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe cupcakes\n\n1 Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Beat the butter and sugar in an electric mixer for 3 minutes on medium speed until light and fluffy.\n\n2 Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until each is fully incorporated. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure even mixing. \n\n3  In a large bowl, sift together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  In another bowl whisk together the buttermilk, vinegar, vanilla extract, and red food coloring. \n\n4 Add a fourth of the dry ingredients and mix, then add a third of the wet. Continue adding in a dry, wet, dry pattern, ending with the dry ingredients. \n\n5 Scoop into cupcake papers, about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way full. Bake for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Rotate the pan after the first 15 minutes of baking to ensure even baking. \n\n6 Allow to cool for one minute in the pan then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. \n\nThe Frosting\n\n1 Cream the butter and cream cheese together, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure even mixing.\n\n2 Add the vanilla extract and mix.\n\n3 Add the powdered sugar, continually taste to get to desired sweetness. Pipe onto cooled cupcakes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Simply Recipes guest author Garrett McCord. ~Elise\nRed velvet cake is classic Americana cooking with its roots in the south. Deliciously festive, moist, flavorful, and maybe a hint of playful tackiness it’s a dessert that has gained newfound popularity in bakeries coast to coast. \nIf you haven’t had it before red velvet is like yellow cake but with a little kiss on the cheek of chocolate. The red color can come from beets or even strawberries but personally I unapologetically prefer red food dye and in large quantities as it does a better job of disguising the brown chocolate without altering the flavor. Be sure to be careful when putting this recipe together as the batter can stain, so you may not want kids putting it together (better to put them on frosting duty). \nAdapted into little red cupcakes and topped with a dollop of cream cheese frosting, they make for a colorful and tasty dessert for late winter picnics and are especially sweet for Valentine’s Day or for the Fourth of July if adorned with some blueberries.\n
610	Perfect Lemonade	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Make simple syrup by heating the sugar and water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved completely.\n2 While the sugar is dissolving, use a juicer to extract the juice from 4 to 6 lemons, enough for one cup of juice.\n3 Add the juice and the sugar water to a pitcher. Add 3 to 4 cups of cold water, more or less to the desired strength. Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes. If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it.\nServe with ice, sliced lemons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Everybody knows how to make lemonade, right? Squeeze some lemons, add sugar and water. But how to make lemonade so that it tastes right everytime? Here’s a surefire method. Remember the starting proportions – 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, 1 cup of lemon juice. (This ratio makes a pretty sweet lemonade. Reduce the amount of sugar if you want your lemonade less sweet or if you are using Meyer lemons which are naturally sweeter than standard lemons.) The secret to perfect lemonade is to start by making sugar syrup, also known as “simple syrup”. Dissolving the sugar in hot water effectively disperses the sugar in the lemonade, instead of having the sugar sink to the bottom.\n
611	Banana Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo need for a mixer for this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). With a wooden spoon, mix butter into the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl. Mix in the sugar, egg, and vanilla. Sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the mixture and mix in. Add the flour last, mix. Pour mixture into a buttered 4x8 inch loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour. Cool on a rack. Remove from pan and slice to serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The best recipes come tried and true from friends who begged them from other friends and so on and so on. That’s the wonderful thing about sharing recipes – the more good recipes we share, the better we all get to eat! This banana bread comes from my friend Heidi who years ago begged this recipe from a ski friend’s mother – Mrs. Hockmeyer (parents of friends are always Mr. and Mrs. no matter how old we get). Mrs. Hockmeyer passed away years ago, but her simple but perfect banana bread lives on for all of us to enjoy.\n
612	Gazpacho	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine all ingredients.  Blend slightly, to desired consistency.  Place in non-metal, non-reactive storage container, cover tightly and refrigerate overnight, allowing flavors to blend.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Gazpacho soup was invented for the summer. Refreshingly cold on hot summer days, this adaptation of the classic Spanish cold tomato soup deliciously combines the best of summer vegetables. Make sure you only use the freshest, highest quality ingredients for this soup.\n
613	Steak Fajitas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix all marinade ingredients. Coat the steak with the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or longer in the fridge. Before you cook the meat, wipe off most of the marinade and sprinkle the steak with salt.\n\n2 Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute. Add the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak. Carne asada and skirt steak will need less time. If the pan starts to smoke too much, reduce the heat to medium-high. You want the steak browned, not burned. Remove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.\n3 Cook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers. Let these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.\n\n4 Slice the meat against the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.\n5 Serve immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Classic Tex Mex, fajitas (pronounced fah-hee-tas) are typically made with grilled strips of skirt steak with onions and bell peppers, and served sizzling hot with fresh tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. You can make fajitas with steak or chicken, or even make it plain vegetarian. Here’s a quick and easy recipe for steak fajitas.\n
614	Swiss Steak	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Rub flour into both sides of the steak.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Heat a wide, shallow (3 inches), covered pan to medium high heat.  Add 2 Tbsp of oil to coat the pan.  Place the steak in the pan, and cook for approximately 10 minutes on each side, enough to brown the steak. \n\n\n\n2 Remove the steak from the pan and set aside.  Add onions and garlic to the pan and another tablespoon of oil.  Cook the onions and garlic for 3-5 minutes, using a metal spatula to scrape up any steak drippings, mixing them in with the onions.  Add half of the herbs to the onions.  Return the steak to the pan, placing it on top of the onions.  Crowd the onions around and on top of the steak.  Sprinkle the rest of the herbs on top of the steak.  Add the 2 cups of puréed tomatoes to the pan.  \n\n3 Cover the pan with a tight fitting lid.  Use a high lid if available.  A high lid will help circulate the steam and moisture from the cooking juices and keep the steak moist. Bring the steak in the tomato purée to a simmer and then lower the heat to the lowest heat possible to maintain a low simmer (we use the warm setting on our electric range).\n\n\n\n4 Cook for 1 1/2 hours.  While the steak is cooking, you may want to slightly pre-cook vegetables that you want to serve with the steak.  For example, for this dish we steamed 4 small, peeled, quartered russet potatoes and 2 carrots, quartered lengthwise and cut into 2 inch segments, for 5-10 minutes.  (You could use other vegetables, such as green beans, or no vegetables at all.) After 1 1/2 hours of cooking time for the steak, we uncovered the pan, turned the steak over, added the potatoes and carrots, covered the pan and cooked the steak and vegetables for another 30 minutes.\n\nThe reason that you might want to pre-cook the vegetables a bit first is that the steak is cooking at a very low heat.  You'll have more control over how cooked the vegetables are if you pre-cook them a bit first.\n\n\n\n5 The steak should be done after a total cooking time of 2 hours.  To check it, you can poke it with a fork.  The meat should be quite tender.  To serve, remove the steak and slice it on a carving board.  Alternatively, you could have started with individual steaks that were smaller.  Spoon the sauce over the steak.\n\nServes 4-6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Swiss steak is a method of slow-cooking a relatively tough cut of beef, such as a round steak. The meat is browned, and then braised in a tomato sauce. According to The American Century Cookbook, recipes first starting showing up for Swiss steak in the 1930s. Reynolds Wrap Aluminum popularized it in the late 40s by promoting the recipe as a use for its foil. You can cook this steak on a stove-top (which is the method we describe here), or wrap it in foil and place on a cookie sheet and cook it in the oven. The “Swiss” in Swiss Steak has nothing to do with Switzerland, but refers to the process of tenderizing a tough cut of meat. The following is my mother’s method for making Swiss Steak.\n
621	Heirloom Tomato Basil Mozzarella Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAssemble the salad with slices of tomatoes, basil leaves, and mozzarella slices. Sprinkle extra virgin olive oil over the salad. Add a dash of vinegar and a very light sprinkling of salt and pepper. For a completely different flavor, you can substitute the mozzarella with thin slices of Parmesan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Summer is tomato and basil season, and there is nothing better than heirloom tomatoes with fresh basil from the garden and fresh mozzarella cheese. What are “heirloom tomatoes”? Heirloom tomatoes are what tomatoes used to be before all of the variety and flavor were bred out of them so they could be more easily transported in trucks to supermarkets. You can find them at farmers’ markets and at Whole Foods, or you can grow your own. They come in many shades of red, yellow, orange, and green, and are somewhat oddly shaped compared to everyday beefsteak tomatoes.\n\n\n
620	Oven-toasted Sonoran Quesadilla	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUsing the convection setting of your oven\n1 Place the tortilla on a large, dark cookie sheet. Spread butter all over the top of the tortilla, making sure to get the butter all the way out to the edges. (The butter is very important! Don't omit.)\n2 Place in the cold oven and cook for 7-10 minutes at 375°F on convection heat, or until the tortilla begins to visibly brown. If you open the oven door you should be able to smell the tortilla beginning to toast.\nThe tortilla is ready for some cheese.\n3 Remove from the oven, sprinkle cheese over the tortilla (add strips of chiles if you want) and return to oven for an additional 2 minutes. Serve immediately.\nIf you are starting with a preheated oven, you will cook it initially for probably only 2 or 3 minutes on convection - watch it carefully, and pull it out when it begins to brown.\nWe recommend the convection oven approach if you have that option as the cooking time (and heating up the oven and your kitchen time) is much shorter.\nUsing a regular oven setting\nIf you don't have a convection oven, then preheat your oven to 350°F. Cook the buttered tortilla initially for approximately 6 minutes (again, check carefully, the tortilla should be getting toasted but not burnt.) Remove from the oven, add the cheese and return to the oven for an additional 2 minutes.\nNote that every oven is different. This is the method that worked for our oven. You will probably need to watch quite carefully the first couple of times you make these, to gauge the time and temperature settings needed for your oven.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mother grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and remembers fondly what she calls “Sonoran Quesadillas” – large, thin, flour tortillas, toasted with butter and cheese, and often topped with strips of mild green chiles. The quesadillas are called “Sonoran” because they are made with especially large, thin, flour tortillas, found in Sonora, the northernmost state of Mexico. They would be served on a large platter, either cut like a pie or not, for everyone to share. They differ from what I would consider a standard quesadilla (see Quesadilla Recipe) in that they are open-faced, extra large, and very crispy.\n\nA few weeks ago mom decided to use some extra large burrito tortillas we get at Trader Joe’s to do an experiment to recreate these delicious quesadillas. The problem is getting them crispy, but not burnt. The Trader Joe’s tortillas are thicker than the traditional Sonoran thin tortilla, so they take a little longer to toast. We experimented with cooking them directly on the racks in the oven, broiling them, cooking them on a large cookie sheet, and cooking them on the stove top. (Watch out America’s Test Kitchen!) The best way, we found, to reproduce these quesadillas was to cook them on a cookie sheet, in a convection oven. Here are the details:\n\n
991	Garlic Chicken with White Wine Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Lightly smash the garlic cloves with the side of a heavy chef's knife, just enough to break the cloves. Leave peel on.\n2 Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat. Pat them dry and sprinkle pieces generously with salt and pepper. Heat 3 Tbsp olive oil in a Dutch oven (or a large thick-bottom pan with a tight fitting cover) on medium high. Working in batches, brown the chicken pieces on all sides. Lay the chicken pieces on the hot oil, do not move until browned, then turn over to other side using tongs. Remove from pan when browned.\n\n3 Add a little more olive oil to the pan if necessary. Add the garlic and sauté until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the wine and the herbs. Bring to a boil. Add the chicken pieces. Reduce the heat to medium low. Cover the pan and simmer until the chicken is cooked through. Move the chicken pieces from top to bottom every 5 minutes for about 20 minutes. Chicken is done when a meat thermometer inserted into thickest part reads 180°F for thighs and 170°F for breasts.\nSeason to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken pieces to a platter; spoon garlic sauce over the chicken.\nServe alone (low carb option) or with rice, noodles, baked or mashed potatoes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A Simply Recipes reader, Ms. Annie M, sent us a garlic chicken recipe she found on Epicurious that looked so good we couldn’t wait to try it. (Annie, by the way, knows how mortified I am by typos and thoughtfully points them out to me whenever she finds them on the site.) The recipe is basically chicken pieces and a lot of garlic cloves that have been browned in olive oil and braised in white wine with herbs. The catch is the garlic. We used 40 unpeeled cloves. Lest the sheer volume of garlic scare you off of this recipe, let me reassure you that the browning and braising mellows out the garlic significantly, so it ends up tasting a lot like roasted garlic. Leaving the peels on the garlic is traditional in Mexican cooking, I imagine it may be in Spanish cooking as well? Not sure. But the peels do have flavor, much like the shells of shrimp. You don’t eat them, but when the dish is done, the garlic just slips out of them. Absolutely delicious recipe, thank you Annie!\n
615	Cobb Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook the bacon in a skillet on medium heat until crisp on both sides.  Remove from skillet and lay out on paper towels to absorb the excess fat.  Allow the bacon to cool. Crumble the bacon and set aside.\n\n2 In a large salad bowl, toss together well the various lettuces and watercress.\n\n3 Compose the salad.  Arrange the chicken, the bacon, the tomato, and the avocado decoratively over the greens and garnish the salad with the grated egg and the chives. \n\n4 In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a slow stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Stir in the Roquefort.  Add sugar to taste, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.  Whisk the dressing.  Serve separately or toss in with the salad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Cobb salad is the quintessential American salad, first pulled together on a whim by Robert Cobb of the former Los Angeles landmark Brown Derby restaurant when he needed to feed Sid Grauman late one night (1937). It was such a hit, movie stars started requesting “Cobb’s salad”, and soon its popularity spread. The original Brown Derby restaurant on Wilshire Blvd. was eventually torn down in the 80s, like so many downtown LA landmarks – Perinos, the Ambassador Hotel – leaving a swath of strip malls in their place. I fondly remember the Brown Derby. It was in the shape of huge brown hat (you couldn’t miss it) and within a few blocks of where we lived when I was a kid. Ah well, big brown hat gone, but thank goodness the salad remains, a legacy of the Golden Era of Hollywood.\n
616	Sesame and Cilantro Vermicelli Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook the pasta in a large saucepan in salted boiling water, according to directions on pasta package. Drain but do not rinse.\n2 While the pasta is cooking, prepare the dressing. In a microwave-safe dish, heat the vegetable oil, sesame oil, and red pepper, in the microwave on high heat for 2 minutes. Add the honey and soy sauce and mix well.\n3 Combine the drained pasta with the dressing in a large bowl until the pasta is well coated. Cover and chill for several hours.\n4 When ready to serve, mix in the cilantro, peanuts, green onions and bell pepper. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If the heat of the summer is getting to you, this is a lovely spicy pasta salad for a hot day. One recent morning, on a day when the mercury eventually hit 105°F, I made this vermicelli pasta early in the morning and then let it marinate all morning in the fridge. By lunch time, it was a snap to quickly pull together.\n
617	Cream of Spinach Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large saucepan over medium heat, sauté onion in butter for 3 minutes or until limp. Add potatoes, chicken broth, water, and bouillon cubes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Add spinach and cook for 2 to 4 minutes longer until spinach is tender.\n2 Working in batches, purée soup mixture in a blender. Return to saucepan. Whisk in half-and-half, salt and pepper.\n3 Over low heat, bring to just before simmering. Whisk in the sour cream. You may want to use an immersion blender to get the sour cream fully incorporated.\nThis soup can be served hot or chilled. Garnish with chopped chives, sprinkles of allspice, or a dollop of sour cream.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This delicious cream of spinach soup is as rich, smooth and creamy as the label “Cream of” would imply. It’s basically a vichyssoise, with spinach in addition to the potatoes, and can be served either hot or chilled.\n
618	Cucumber Yogurt Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst taste the cucumbers to make sure that they are not bitter. Depending on the variety of cucumber you are using, and many other factors, you may find a cucumber that is distinctly bitter in taste. If this happens, soak the cucumber slices in salted water for half an hour, or longer, until the bitterness is reduced, then rinse and drain before using.\nTo make the salad, simply gently mix together the ingredients. Salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We eat a lot of hot and spicy dishes around here; a great way to cool the palate is with the delicious combination of yogurt and cucumber. This easy-to-make cucumber salad, also called “tzatziki”, is a refreshing accompaniment to spicy dishes such as chili beans, enchiladas, and Indian food.\n
619	Chickpea (Garbanzo Bean) and Tomato Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the garbanzo beans, tomatoes, eggs, and onion in a large bowl.\n2 Separately mix the dressing ingredients in a jar or a small bowl - olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Pour over salad ingredients. Sprinkle on chopped parsley. Serve immediately.\nYou can chill the undressed salad up to six hours, until ready to serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Fresh summer tomatoes, garbanzo beans (also known as chickpeas), hard boiled eggs, and sweet onions, tossed with a light vinaigrette – here are the makings of a surprisingly delicious summer salad. I made this for lunch yesterday from a recipe in a recent issue of Sunset Magazine. I particularly love the balance in the salad – the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar with the sweetness of the onions, the parsley which supplies a bitter, the salt, the olive oil, and the protein from the beans and eggs. It’s a complete, light meal in itself.\n
622	Grilled Lime Chicken with Black Bean Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, oregano, salt and pepper in a glass bowl and mix well. Trim the chicken breasts, then add to the marinade. Cover lightly and marinate, turning the chicken occasionally, for 2 hours at room temp (or overnight in the fridge).\n2 Prepare Black Bean Sauce while chicken is marinating. Place beans in a large sauce-pan or soup pan, and add all remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 1/2 hours. Add additional water if needed. Remove bay leaves, then transfer the bean mixture to a food processor. Process well, adding water if needed to make desired consistency. (I haven't needed to add any, and I like the sauce moderately thick).\n3 Preheat oven to 350° F, and prepare grill (gas or hot coals). Place the red onion slices in the bottom of a shallow, oven-proof dish, then cover with chicken breasts and marinade. Cover the dish loosely with aluminum foil, then bake for 15-20 minutes (only until the chicken is opaque). Remove the chicken breasts to a platter and set aside. Continue to cook the onions in the marinade (covered) for 10 minutes. Save the marinade for grilling.\n4 Place the chicken breasts on the grill over very hot coals or gas flame, and grill until they are thoroughly cooked but still moist (approximately 2 minutes on each side). Drizzle with remaining marinade while cooking. Remove to platter when grilled.\nServe the grilled chicken with the red onions, drizzle with the black bean sauce. Garnish with sour cream, guacamole, tomatoes or fresh cilantro - or serve with a leafy green side salad - as desired.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This recipe for grilled chicken, marinated in lime juice, and served with a cilantro infused black bean sauce comes from my dear friend Steve-Anna, who, by the way, lives in Arizona, and is not afraid of using her grill in the summer desert heat. Steve-Anna has contributed several recipes to this site, all winners. Making this tonight, I was inspired to pull out the electric grill which hasn’t been used in years. We cleaned it, reviewed the instructions, got it all set up, plugged it in, turned it on, and blew out the electricity in half of the house. So much for the outdoor grill. Plan B – the cast-iron grill pan – worked just fine. We used 2 pounds of chicken breasts, instead of the 1 1/2 the recipe calls for, and cooked it for 30 minutes versus 20 in the recipe. The breasts were perfectly done. The black bean sauce is a must for the chicken. I think I may add a little sour cream to it next time. Thanks Steve-Anna, for yet another terrific recipe!\n
623	Marion Blackberry Shortcake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPut clean berries into a large bowl.  Using a potato masher, gently mash down on the berries, until you've crushed about half of them.  Add sugar to taste.  Mix and let sit for 15 minutes for the berries to macerate.\n\nBiscuit recipes\n\nBiscuits from scratch\n\n3 cups all purpose flour\n3 Tbsp granulated sugar\n1 1/2 Tbsp baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n12 Tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream\n1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\nSift the sugar, flour, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl.  Mix with a fork to combine.  Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter or a fork until the largest pieces of butter are the size of peas.  (Or pulse several times in a food processor.)  Combine the vanilla and cream in a liquid measure.  Make a well in the center of the flour and and pour the cream into the well.  Mix with a fork until the dough is evenly moistened and just combined; it should look shaggy and still feel a little dry.  Knead gently by hand five or six times to create a loose ball.  \n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into an 8-inch square, 3/4 to 1 inch thick.  Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper, cover with plastic and chill for 20 minutes in the refrigerator.  Heat the oven to 425ºF.   Remove the dough from refrigerator.  Cut the dough into 9 even squares and spread them about 2 inches apart from each other on the baking sheet.  Bake until the biscuits are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.\n\nMakes 9 biscuits.  (Adapted from Fine Cooking Magazine, July 2003)\n\nBisquick biscuits:\n\n2 1/3 cups Bisquick baking mix\n3 Tbsp butter, melted\n1/2 cup milk\n3 Tbsp sugar\n\nHeat oven to 425°F.  Stir baking mix, melted butter, milk, and 3 Tbsp of sugar in a mixing bowl until soft dough forms.  Drop by six spoonfuls on to a greased cookie sheet or a sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.  \n\nMakes 6 biscuits.\n\nGluten-free biscuits:\n\n1-1/2 cups Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour (Bob's Red Mill)\n1 Tbsp. Sugar \n2 tsp. Baking Powder \n1/4 tsp. Baking Soda \n1 tsp. Xanthan Gum \n1 tsp. Guar Gum \n1/2 tsp. Salt \n\n1/4 cup Shortening \n1/2 cup Milk \n1 large Egg White \n\nPreheat oven to 350º. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or grease lightly. \n\nIn food processor, pulse dry ingredients (flour through salt) with shortening until mixture is consistency of small peas. Add milk and egg white. Pulse until dough forms ball, scraping down sides with spatula, if necessary. Dough will be somewhat soft. \n\nPlace the dough on parchment-lined or greased baking sheet that’s been lightly dusted with rice flour. Gently pat to 3/4-inch thick circle with hands or spatula. Lightly dust dough with rice flour. Cut into ten 2-inch circles with floured biscuit cutter. Shape remaining dough to 3/4-inch thick and cut again. If dough is sticky, lightly dust with more flour. Arrange evenly on baking sheet. \n\nBake 12-15 minutes or until browned. Best when served warm or gently reheated in microwave oven. Serves 10.  (Recipe from Bob's Red Mill)\n\nWhip cream in a blender, adding a drop or two of vanilla and, if you like, a teaspoon of sugar.\n\nTo serve, break up one biscuit per person into big pieces into a bowl.  Ladle berries over the biscuit.  Add a dolop of whipped cream.\n\nServes 6\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Who says strawberries have a monopoly on shortcake desserts? Mid summer is the season for many varieties of blackberries, which are delicious served over biscuits with whipped cream. Sweet and juicy marionberries are native of Oregon, but we found some at Summerfield Berry Farm outside of Placerville, CA. I honestly think they are the best berries we have ever had. \n \nThe directions for blackberry shortcake are identical to those for strawberry shortcake. (See strawberry shortcake recipe).\n
624	Mom’s Pasta Primavera	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (for your pasta).\n\n2 Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat.  Add the vegetables, stir to coat with oil.  Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until vegetables are just cooked.  Turn off heat, but let pan stay on the burner.\n\n3  While you are cooking the vegetables, add the dry pasta to the boiling water and follow the cooking instructions for the pasta.  You want to time it so that the pasta is done soon after the vegetables.\n\n\n\n4 Add a 1/4 cup of the spaghetti, marinara, or tomato sauce to the vegetables, along with 1/4 cup of water to thin the sauce.  If you are using a prepared spaghetti or marinara sauce, you don't need to add much seasoning, just a 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning or herbes de Provence, a few sprinkles of garlic salt, and salt and pepper to taste.  If you are using a plain tomato sauce, you might want to start out cooking the vegetables by cooking a minced clove of garlic first, and then adding the vegetables, and then add a bit more of the seasoning (to taste).  Spaghetti and marinara sauce are already seasoned.\n\n5 Once the pasta is ready - cooked but still a bit firm, or al dente - drain the pasta and put it directly into the skillet with the vegetables.  Adjust seasoning.  Add more sauce if needed.  Gently mix in the cherry tomatoes.\n\nServe with some freshly grated Parmesan, if you like.  A little bit of chopped fresh basil would go nicely with this as well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The word primavera refers to being served with fresh vegetables; it is from the Italian (alla) primavera, or (in the) spring (style). Pasta primavera is almost always a simple-to-prepare dish using the fresh vegetables of the season. In spring you might make it with asparagus and peas, later in the summer with tomatoes and zucchini. Sometimes it uses a cream sauce, sometimes a marinara sauce, and sometimes, just with some olive oil and shaved Parmesan. The following recipe is how my mother likes to prepare Pasta Primavera – whatever vegetables we have on hand with a little marinara sauce.\n
625	Parmesan Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Preheat oven to 450°F. Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels.\n2 In a bowl, combine the minced garlic with the melted butter. In another bowl mix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan, parsley, salt, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and pepper. Dip chicken pieces into garlic butter, then into crumb mixture to coat.\n3 Place coated chicken pieces on to a 9x13 (or larger) roasting dish. Try to leave a little room between each piece. Drizzle with remaining garlic butter and bake uncovered 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Note that the chicken will get much more browned on the bottom side than on the top.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When we were kids, my mother used to make this Parmesan chicken that was so good we would fight for drippings, every last crumb. She would use boneless, skinless chicken (after having de-boned a whole chicken and then used the bones for stock) and cut the pieces into much smaller pieces. The chicken would cook much faster this way, and the ratio of buttery, crunchy coating to meat much higher. Mom forgot the exact recipe over time, but I think we came pretty close in recreating it with this chicken parmesan recipe.\n
626	Pesto Pasta Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook pasta according to instructions on the package. Make sure the water is salted (at least a half teaspoon per quart). Remove pasta from heat and strain when pasta is cooked, but still firm (al dente).\n2 While the pasta is cooking, toast the pine nuts in a small pan over medium-high heat. Keep an eye on them because pine nuts can go from lovely and toasty to acrid and burnt in seconds. When most of the nuts have a blush of golden brown on them, move them to a cool bowl to rest. They will burn if you leave them in the pan.\n3 Put pasta in a big bowl. Mix in fresh basil pesto, green olives, and pine nuts. Gently mix in cherry tomatoes, peas, fresh basil leaves and olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The season for potluck barbecues is here and a quick and easy dish to prepare for a gathering is pesto pasta salad. Spiral pasta catches and hold the bits of basil pesto. You can dress up the pesto and pasta with any number of things; cherry tomatoes, nuts, peas, and olive tapenade is what I had on hand for this particular version, but you could also add goat cheese, slivered almonds, sun-dried tomatoes, or snow peas.\nWhat’s your favorite summer pasta salad? Let us know in the comments.\n
627	Berry Tart	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPre-bake the Crust\n\n1 In a food processor, combine flour, ground almonds, salt and sugar, pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add almond extract to 4 Tbsp of ice water, then add the almond water to the flour and pulse a few times to incorporate.  Add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition, until the dough begins to clump together.  Remove the dough from the food processor and form into a ball onto a lightly floured surface.  Shape the dough into a disc, 5-inches wide.  Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.\n\nThe dough pictured is ready to take out of the food processor.\n\n2 Remove the dough disc from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Sprinkle some flour on top of the disk. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12 inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, use a metal spatula to check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. Add a few sprinkles of flour if necessary to keep the dough from sticking.  Carefully place dough into a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.  Gently press dough into pan; have the dough come up 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the tart pan.  Put tart pan in the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n3 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Take tart pan out of freezer and poke the bottom in several places with a fork.   Line with aluminum foil, with enough extra foil off the two of the sides to use for lifting.  Fill with pie weights - beans, ceramic or stainless pie weights.  Place a shallow baking pan on the bottom rung of the oven to catch drippings.  Put the tart pan in the oven on the middle rack.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and remove the pie weights.  (I lift the hot beans out by holding on to the aluminum foil and place the foil and beans into a large bowl to cool before storing.) Return the tart pan to the oven for 10-15 more minutes - bake until lightly golden.  Remove from oven and let cool completely.\n\nAssemble the tart\n\n4 In a medium bowl, using a hand electric mixer or stand mixer, beat together the mascarpone, cream, and sugar at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute.  Scoop mixture into tart crust, and spread so that it is level.\n\n5 Combine marmalade and liqueur into a small saucepan and heat on medium heat until well mixed.  If you are using a liqueur that is not sweet, you might want to add a teaspoon of sugar.  Cook down to 3 Tbsp.  Put berries into a bowl and pour the marmalade mixture over the berries.  Use a large rubber spatula to gently mix the berries so they are all well coated with the marmalade mixture.  Use a slotted spoon to lift up the berries from their bowl and place on the mascarpone cream.\n\nRemove the rim of the tart pan before serving.  (You may need to use a knife to gently separate the edges of the tart from the pan.)\n\nNote: The marmalade and liqueur mixture brings added sweetness, berry flavor, and citrus acidity to the tart.  The acid from the citrus sharpens the flavor of the berries.  If you don't have marmalade on hand, and don't want to buy some just for this recipe, you might try making a berry coating with sugar, water, and a little lemon juice and lemon zest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every year the mother of my best friend from high school invites me to her 4th of July party. Mrs. Mull knows I like to cook so she encourages me, “Of course you’ll bring something wonderful to the party, Elise; I would be so disappointed if you didn’t!” At 79, Dorothy knows exactly what to say to inspire me to do my best. This year, the goal was a berry tart – blueberries and red berries on a white filling – so patriotic! My father and I experimented with several tarts in preparation for today, and this one was definitely the best. It’s based on a recipe from The Gourmet Cookbook, but with a different crust. \n
658	Sweet and Sour Red Cabbage	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.  Add cabbage and sauté until slightly wilted, about 5 minutes.  Add sugar, toss to coat evenly.  Add vinegar.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cover, simmer until cabbage is tender, stirring often, about 30 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nServes 6-8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A reader emailed the other day asking if I was Austrian on account of the sauerkraut and cabbage recipes on Simply Recipes. My father’s grandparents on both sides were from Austria and he grew up with many traditional German and Austrian dishes and a love for cooked cabbage in various forms. This love he passed on to me and I’m delighted to present his sweet and sour red cabbage recipe.\n
628	Cardamom Honey Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf a recipe calls for ground cardamom, it is best to start with whole pods.  Break open the pods to release the tiny brown and black cardamom seeds.  Use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to grind the seeds.\n\n1 Preheat oven to 390°F.  Warm the honey, stir in the sherry, cardamom and peppercorns.  Place marinade and chicken in a large bowl, coat chicken with marinade.  Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\n2 Heat olive oil in a large frying pan at medium high heat.  Sear the chicken, skin side down, until golden.\n\n3 Place lemon slices in a roasting pan.  Lay the chicken pieces on top.  Brush with the marinade.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Place in the oven and bake until done, approximately 15 minutes for breasts, 20 minutes for thighs, wings, and drumsticks.  Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.  Pour out drippings from the pan into a gravy boat for gravy.\n\nServe with rice, mashed potatoes, or couscous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	On a trip to New Zealand, my hosts sent me home with a wonderful cookbook from BeesOnline, a local café and honey factory right outside Auckland. The Cardamom and Honey-Glazed Chicken recipe caught our eye and we made it a few days ago. I’ve never thought to use cardamom as a spice for chicken before; the result was quite fragrant and delicious. The leftovers made for a flavorful chicken salad the next day.\n
629	Blueberry Muffins	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F with a rack in the lower middle.\n\n2 In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients—the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.\n\n3 In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together, until fluffy.  Add the eggs to the mixture one at a time, beating after each one.  Mix in the lemon zest.\n\n4 Add one third of the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar/egg mixture and beat until just incorporated.  Mix in one third of the yogurt.  Mix in another third of the dry ingredients.  Beat in a second third of the yogurt.  Mix in the remaining dry ingredients and then the remaining yogurt.  Be careful to mix until just incorporated.  Do not over mix!  \n\n5 Gently fold the blueberries into the mixture.  \n\n6 Use standard 12-well muffin tins.  Place a muffin liner in each well of the muffin tin, or if you don't have muffin liners, coat the inside of the muffin tin wells with vegetable oil or butter with a pastry brush or with cooking spray.  Distribute the dough equally among the cups. Don't be afraid to fill them high.\n\n7 Place in the oven and bake until the muffins are golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Test with a bamboo skewer to make sure the centers of the muffins are done.  Let the muffins cool in the muffin tin for 5 minutes, then remove them from the tin and let sit on a wire rack for 10 more minutes. Serve slightly warm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There are three things I have a hard time resisting – my dad’s tapioca pudding, Belgian dark chocolate, and freshly baked blueberry muffins. Muffins are not as easy to get right as one might think. Too dry, too dense, to sugary – these are all problems that one can encounter when trying to bake the perfect muffin. This blueberry muffin recipe however, from The Best Recipe cookbook, makes them just right – light, fluffy, and full of blueberries.\n
630	Summer Squash Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If you are starting with raw pine nuts, toast them first.  Heat a small skillet on medium high heat.  Add the pine nuts.  Stir gently as the pine nuts start to brown.  When slightly browned, remove from heat and let cool.\n\n2 Slice the squash into paper-thin slices using a mandoline or other slicer.  Set aside in a bowl.\n\n3  Stack the mint leaves, roll them together lengthwise and slice crosswise to make very thin slivers.  Add to squash in bowl.\n\n4 Combine the oil and lemon juice in a small bowl and whisk together.  Whisk in the salt and pepper and pour the dressing over the contents of the bowl.  Add the pine nuts and toss all together, gently, but thoroughly.  Let mixture stand for at least 10 minutes to soften the squash and develop the flavors.\n\n5 Transfer salad to serving dish or to four individual salad plates.  Garnish with shavings of cheese made with a vegetable peeler and a few sprigs of fresh mint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Evie suspected that when I tried her summer squash salad recipe that I would have to eat my words (no pun intended) regarding my mom being the only one who could prepare squash well. Well, I have eaten my words, and this fabulous salad as well. This is a lovely way to prepare summer squash or zucchini – thinly sliced, marinated briefly with mint in olive oil and lemon juice, tossed with toasted pine nuts, and served with shaved Parmesan. A veritable zucchini carpaccio. I have made one small adjustment to Evie’s original recipe, by increasing the amount of olive oil and lemon juice recommended. I found I needed more to adequately coat all of the squash.\n
631	Summer Pea Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium saucepan (2 1/2 to 3 quart) melt the butter on medium heat.  Add shallots and cook until softened, but not browned, a couple minutes.  \n\n2 Add the broth and mint sprigs to the shallots, increase the heat and bring to a boil.  Add the frozen peas and salt and pepper to taste.  Return to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the peas are just tender, 3-5 minutes.\n\n3 Discard the mint and purée the soup in a blender until completely smooth.  Blend in the cream.  Taste and correct seasoning.  \n\nReheat to serve warm, or chill to serve cold.  Serve garnished with crème fraîche and mint strips.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every time I take a cooking class from Sacramento chef Evie Lieb I’m inspired for weeks with new ideas and recipes for bringing out the best from ingredients. This summer pea soup is an Evie inspiration, a re-creation of soup she often finds in restaurants throughout France during her summer trips. Unlike split pea soup, this soup uses frozen peas (Petite Peas are available at Trader Joe’s), and it cooks up in less than half an hour. It’s just as good cold as hot, so it’s ideal for the warm days of summer. An infusion of mint in the broth adds a delicious touch to the flavor of the peas.\n
632	Papaya, Prosciutto, and Lime	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nUsing a vegetable peeler, peel away the outer skin of the papaya.  Cut the papaya in half.  Using a metal spoon, scoop out and discard the seeds.  (The seeds are edible, by the way.  They taste peppery, like nasturtium flowers, and can be used in salads.)  Slice the the papaya halves into wedges lengthwise.  Arrange on a plate.  Roll up thin sheets of prosciutto and place between the papaya wedges.  Squeeze fresh lime juice over the papaya and prosciutto.\n\nIf you would like to serve the papaya as an appetizer, cut the papaya into 1-inch pieces, sprinkle on some lime juice, wrap each piece with some prosciutto, and secure with a toothpick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of my most favorite breakfasts is a poached egg on toast, with a side of papaya and lime. Including some prosciutto with the papaya just takes it up a notch further. Papaya is filled with enzymes that help digestion, and is even used to tenderize meat.\n
634	Tortilla Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 If you are starting with somewhat old, dried out tortillas, great. If not and you are starting with relatively fresh tortillas, put them on a baking sheet and put them in the oven at 200°F for 10-15 minutes to dry them out a bit. It is best to start with tortillas that don't have a lot of moisture in them. Cut tortillas in half, and then cut the halves into 1/4-inch wide strips. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a 3-quart pot. Working in three batches, fry the tortilla strips in the oil, until lightly browned and crisp. Remove the tortilla strips from the pan and let drain on a paper-towel-lined plate.\n2 Add the chopped onions to the pan, cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the chopped chile and cook for 2-3 minutes more, until the onions and chiles have softened. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the broth, tomatoes, and salt. Increase the heat to high, heat until the soup begins to boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the shredded chicken and cook until heated through.\n3 To serve, pit, peel, and cut the avocado into 1-inch pieces. Divide half of tortilla strips among 4 individual serving bowls; ladle in soup. Top with avocado and cheese; garnish with remaining tortilla strips and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tortilla soup encompasses all the things I love best in Mexican cooking. Do you like salsa? avocado? cilantro? fresh hot tortilla chips? Tortilla soup is like a soup version of my favorite enchilada, with chicken, and tortilla chips. And avocado. We originally found this recipe at the website of Muir Glen, makers of organic canned tomatoes, and have made a few slight adjustments to it. Muir Glen makes a particularly good “fire-roasted” canned tomato, which is well suited to Mexican dishes.\n
635	Mint Tea with Lemon Verbena	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBring a pot of fresh water almost, but not quite to a boil. Put the mint and verbena leaves in a teapot. Pour the hot water over the leaves. Let sit for 3-5 minutes. Strain into tea cups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A while ago I ordered some herbal tea at the Chez Panisse Café in Berkeley. The tea arrived in a large, clear, glass teapot, filled with green leaves and hot water. The tea was lovely – light, lemony, minty. After we finished it, my curiosity got the best of me and I started fishing out the leaves from the pot, wondering what was in this tea anyway? Our server noticed this odd behavior and quickly came to the table offering to provide us with fresh leaves. “These leaves here are mint, but what are these long green ones?” I asked. “Lemon verbena,” was the answer and she happily addressed my battery of questions about this herb. Lemon verbena is a bushy shrub that grows quite well in Northern California. It originally comes from South America, but has been cultivated in Europe since the 1600s. It has a strong lemon scent and is used to add a lemon flavor to many dishes. In anticipation of making my own verbena mint tea, I planted some this spring. True to expectations, the not-yet-a-bush plant is thriving. Here’s the method for making simple mint tea with lemon verbena:\n
636	Mom’s Summer Squash	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put onion, garlic, squash, bell pepper into a large saucepan with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Put on high heat and brown the vegetables slightly to develop flavor.  As you are browning, sprinkle either dried basil or chopped fresh basil on the vegetables.  When vegetables are slightly browned, remove from heat, add the slices of cheese, and cover the pan.  \n\n2 In a separate stick-free fry pan, put the tomatoes and cook at medium hi heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  You want to let the juice from the tomatoes evaporate some.  After 5 minutes, add the tomatoes to the rest of the vegetables and stir.  Salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mother is the only person I have ever known who can make summer squash taste this good. Often this time of year gardens are overflowing with zucchini and summer squash. This quick and easy recipe is a great way to use up some of the bounty. Note that summer squash varies in tenderness, sometimes you need to cook them a little longer, sometimes a little less.\n
637	Warm Green Bean and Pancetta Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Core the tomatoes. Slice them in half horizontally and gently squeeze out most of the seeds and juice. (Alternatively, you can use your fingers to gently remove the seeds and pulp from the tomatoes.) Chop the tomatoes into 1-inch pieces. Set aside.\n2 In a small bowl, mix the honey and sherry vinegar. Set aside.\n3 Heat a large sauté pan to medium heat. Cook the strips of pancetta in batches until golden and crisp. Let drain on a paper towel set over a plate to absorb the excess fat. Discard all but 1 Tbsp of the fat remaining in the pan (don't put down the drain or you'll clog your drain when the fat cools). Add 3 Tbsp of olive oil to the pan, set aside. Chop the pancetta.\n4 Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Add the beans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the beans. Put beans into a large serving bowl. Add the tomatoes.\n5 Heat the oil in the skillet that was used to cook the pancetta on medium heat. Whisk in the vinegar honey mixture. Turn the heat up and continue to whisk as the mixture boils and blends. Pour out the hot dressing on to the beans and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chopped pancetta and Parmesan and toss.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Now this is a salad made for summer – fresh garden green beans, ripe tomatoes, Parmesan, and pancetta. You can substitute bacon for the pancetta, but if pancetta is available, we recommend using it. The flavor works marvelously well with the other ingredients.\n
638	Peach Blueberry Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Pulse together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a food processor until combined. Add butter and pulse just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Add egg and vanilla and pulse just until dough clumps and begins to form a ball, about 15 pulses.\n2 Butter and dust with flour the inside of your springform pan. Press dough onto bottom and evenly (about 1/4 inch thick) about two inches up side of springform pan with floured fingertips. Chill pastry in pan until firm, about 10 minutes.\n3 Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.\n4 Make the filling while the pastry chills. Grind 2 tablespoons sugar with flour and tapioca in grinder until tapioca is powdery. Tip: f you don't have a spice or coffee grinder, and you have a blender, you can use a 8 oz mason jar with the blender to grind the tapioca. Just put the tapioca, flour and sugar in the mason jar, unscrew the bottom (including blade) of your blender container from the container and screw it on to the top of the mason jar, with the blade pointing inside the jar. Then just invert the mason jar on to the blender base and use the blender to grind the contents. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining 6 tablespoons sugar. Add peaches, blueberries, and lemon juice and gently toss to coat.\n5 Spoon filling into pastry and bake, loosely covered with a sheet of foil, until filling is bubbling in center and crust is golden, about 1 3/4 hours.\n6 Transfer cake in pan to a rack and cool, uncovered, 20 minutes, then carefully remove side of pan. Cool cake to barely warm or room temperature, then cut into thick wedges with a sharp knife before serving.\nNote that although the cake will come out of the oven somewhat liquidy. The liquid should gel nicely as the cake cools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I found this peach blueberry cake recipe on epicurious and couldn’t resist trying it. The crust is almost biscuit-like and has a rich buttery flavor. Although the original recipe calls for the cake to be cooked for 1 3/4 hours, I ended up cooking mine for 2 hours, the last 15 minutes of which were without the foil so the top could brown a little. The epicurious recipe doesn’t call for buttering and flouring the pan first. I found that mine stuck a bit and I had to use a sharp knife to separate the cake from the pan. So I suggest using a stick-free springform pan or buttering and flouring your pan. Also, if you don’t have a spice grinder, mom showed me a convenient trick using a blender and a mason jar. Details follow.\n
639	Mango Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine all of the ingredients in a bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.   If the salsa ends up being a little too hot or acidic for your taste, you can temper it by adding some diced avocado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Fresh mango salsa is easy to make and perfect with halibut or salmon or as the salsa in fish tacos. \n
640	White Beans and Cherry Tomato Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Start by making the dressing. Put the garlic and rosemary in olive oil in a small saucepan. Heat on medium until the rosemary begins to sizzle. Remove the pan from the heat and let sit for 20 minutes, allowing the rosemary and garlic to infuse in the oil.\n2 Remove rosemary sprig from the oil, discard. Remove the garlic from the oil, reserving the oil. Add the garlic, anchovies (omit for vegetarian option), Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, lemon zest, and lemon juice to a food processor. Pulse until smoth.\n3 In a medium bowl, gently fold the garlic mixture in with the beans until they are well coated. Let sit for a few minutes for the beans to absorb. Gently mix in the reserved olive oil, tomatoes, and parsley.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If you’ve ever grown cherry tomatoes in your garden, you know how wonderfully prolific they can be in summer months. The following salad combines the sweetness of summer cherry tomatoes with white beans and parsley. The secret sauce is the dressing, which includes garlic and rosemary infused olive oil, and a paste made of garlic, lemon, Parmesan and anchovies. If you want a vegetarian option, omit the anchovies, if not, by all means include them. Or, if you don’t have access to anchovies, add a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce.\n
641	Applesauce Spice Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter and flour an 8-in square baking pan, set aside.\n2 Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Set aside.\n3 In an electric mixer, beat butter until light, add sugar and beat until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition. Add the vanilla and the applesauce and beat until smooth.\n4 Mix in half of the dry ingredients. Just before they are blended, add the thinned yogurt (or buttermilk). Then mix in the rest of the dry ingredients and the nuts and raisins, until completely incorporated. Do not over-mix.\n5 Pour out the batter into your prepared cake pan. Place in the middle rack of the 375°F oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, until done. The cake should spring back to the touch, and a toothpick or thin skewer should come out clean after being inserted in various spots in the middle of the cake. Remove the cake from the oven. Let cool for 15 minutes. Then invert to cool completely on a rack.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	July marks the beginning of the apple season here. The brightly striped Gravensteins are the first to ripen. And when they do, we spend weeks making homemade applesauce and apple butter. As our freezer is now packed with applesauce, and there’s more to come, I thought I would experiment with a recipe in the newly published, practical cookbook Kitchen Sense by Mitchell Davis. The applesauce spice cake came out as good as promised – super moist and spicy. Although the recipe is billed as a “cake”, it is similar to banana, zucchini and pumpkin breads; it would make a great muffin as well.\n
642	Berry Banana Smoothie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPut all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of my father’s favorite anytime indulgences is making a smoothie with a ripe banana, some of our homemade plum jam, plain yogurt, and honey. In the late fall, he’ll swap out the jam for ripe kiwi-fruit. Personally, I’m a blueberry and strawberry fan. Actually, I can’t remember ever meeting a smoothie I didn’t like (have great plans for the papaya ripening on the counter). Do you have a favorite smoothie recipe? If so, please let us know in the comments. In the meantime, what follows is a super simple recipe for either a strawberry or blueberry smoothie.\n
643	Zucchini with Thyme	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter on medium heat. Add the onion and parsley, sprinkle with salt, and cook until soft, but not browned.\n\n2 Add the zucchini sticks and thyme. Sprinkle with a little more salt and some black pepper. Gently stir to coat the zucchini. Cover and cook until tender, from 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how tender the the raw zucchini is to begin with, and how small you have sliced the pieces. Check and stir every few minutes. Be careful not to overcook.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe and photos updated July, 2013\nThis recipe is adapted from a recipe in a decade-old Food and Wine magazine of my father’s. It’s zucchini batons sautéed in a little butter and olive oil with onion, parsley, and thyme. You cook the zucchini batons until they are just cooked through, still firm, and gently infused with the flavor of the thyme. The original recipe calls for the zucchini to be cooked for 20 to 30 minutes, which is too long for our tender garden zucchini. My mother tells me that depending on the source and the time in the season, zucchinis can widely vary in toughness. So my advice is to watch it closely and when it is close to being done, take it off the heat. The original recipe also called for a bouillon cube for seasoning. We just omit the bouillon cube and add more salt and pepper. Perfect!\n\n\n
644	Creamed Corn	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 In a large saucepan, melt 1 Tbsp of the butter on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes until translucent.\n2 While the onion is cooking, remove the kernels from the corn. Stand a corn cob vertically over a large, shallow pan (like a roasting pan). Using a sharp knife, use long, downward strokes of the knife to remove the kernels from the cob. Use the edge of a spoon to scrape the sides of the cob to remove any remaining pulp.\n3 Add the corn to the onions and butter in the saucepan. Add 2/3 a cup of water and the remaining 1 Tbsp of butter. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and cover. Cook for 10-15 minutes until the corn is tender.\n4 Add the sugar, nutmeg, and cream to the corn. Cook, uncovered, for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Corn season has finally arrived. This morning my father picked up some yellow corn from the local farmer’s market that was so fresh we could eat it raw. Must have been picked this morning. Did you know you could eat corn raw? You can if it has been picked within a few hours, at least the sweet corn we get. I was inspired by a recipe in Everyday Food to make creamed corn, which is quite a treat when the corn is so fresh. I added some nutmeg, and a little more butter to the original recipe.\n
645	Old Fashioned Pink Lemonade	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Make a "simple syrup" by heating sugar and 1 cup of the water in a small saucepan until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Remove from heat.\n\n2 Stir together the remaining water, cranberry juice, lemon juice and simple syrup.   Make adjustments to taste.  Chill for an hour, or add ice to cool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I was inspired by reading this post at Weddings and Food to make some pink lemonade today. Isn’t it pretty? I think it is a little pinker than what we used to get frozen in the can growing up. Why is pink lemonade so much more appealing than regular lemonade? Doesn’t the canned stuff just has food dye in it to make it pink? I haven’t bought it in decades so don’t really know. This version, with a gentle addition of cranberry juice is the perfect refreshing cooler for a hot summer day.\n
646	Lemon Ginger Muffins	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Adjust the oven rack to the middle-lower part of the oven. Preheat oven to 375°F.\n2 Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and set aside.\n3 Using a vegetable peeler, peel off the lemon zest from one large lemon (avoid the white pith). Coarsely chop the zest. You should have approximately 1/4 cup of chopped lemon zest. Add this zest, the cubed fresh ginger, and 1/4 cup of sugar to a food processor. Pulse until a paste forms.\n4 In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and remaining 3/4 cup of sugar together, beating until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating until incorporated after each one. Beat in the lemon zest and ginger paste.\n5 Beat in one half of the dry ingredients until just incorporated. Beat in one third of the yogurt. Beat in half of the remaining dry ingredients. Beat in a second third of the yogurt. Beat in the remaining dry ingredients and then the remaining yogurt. Again be careful to beat until just incorporated. Do not over beat.\n\n6 Use a standard 12-muffin muffin pan. Coat each muffin cup lightly with olive oil, grapeseed oil, or a little melted butter using a pastry brush. Distribute the muffin dough equally among the cups. Bake until muffins are golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Test with a long toothpick (we use a thin bamboo skewer) to make sure the center of the muffins are done. Set on wire rack to cool.\n7 While the muffins are cooling, in a bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice for the glaze. Add more lemon juice if necessary. While the muffins are still a bit warm, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze over each muffin. The muffins will absorb some of the glaze, so you add more glaze to each muffin if you like.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I’ve been experimenting lately with lemon ginger muffins, looking for just the right recipe. Unfortunately, with all the heat we’ve been having around here lately, my experiments took a hiatus for a couple of weeks. Who wants to turn on the oven when the AC is struggling to keep the house below 80°F? In California we’ve finally had a break in the hot weather (my apologies to those of you on the East Coast who are getting it now) and I got up early this morning to bake these muffins. They are based on the blueberry muffins recipe, but use lemon zest and ginger in place of the berries, and have a lemon sugar glaze.\n
647	Stewed Tomatoes with Butter Toasted Croutons	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Put peeled, chopped tomatoes, butter, sugar, salt and pepper into a small saucepan. Heat to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Let simmer for 20-30 minutes or until tomatoes are cooked, soft, and the flavors have blended. Add chopped basil and add more butter, sugar, salt and pepper if needed for balance.\n\n2 Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a small frying pan on medium heat. Add the bread cubes, arrange in a single layer on the pan. Let gently cook on medium heat so that the bread dries out and gets slightly toasted. Turn pieces over to toast other sides. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the croutons are crunchy dry, and slightly toasted. Sprinkle with garlic salt. Remove from heat.\nServe stewed tomatoes with a few croutons on top of each individual serving, and the rest of the croutons available in a small bowl to add as desired.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Stewed tomatoes is one dish I’ve never had any place but at home, cooked by my mother. I’ve never seen them on a menu anywhere, have you? Too bad, too; as they are truly delicious, and so easy to make. Warning – do not skimp on the butter or sugar. The sugar is needed to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and the butter is absolutely necessary for the taste. This batch was made with fresh heirloom tomatoes from the market; the better quality tomato you start with, the better the result will be. That said, during most of the year when farm fresh juicy tomatoes are not available we will make stewed tomatoes with canned tomatoes. We also often mix in some cooked elbow macaroni instead of serving it with croutons. Oddly enough, stewed tomatoes of some sort is what we usually have to accompany tuna macaroni salad. Something about the over all mix of the flavors really works.\n
648	Sour Cream Apple Pie with Streusel Topping	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n2 Beat together sour cream, sugar, flour, salt, vanilla and egg (can beat by hand). Add apples, mixing carefully to coat well.\n3 Put filling into a pie shell and bake at 400 degrees initially for 25 min.\n4 Remove from oven and sprinkle with Cinnamon Crumb Topping. Bake for and additional 20 more minutes.\nLet cool for a hour before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	You know that when your friend’s smile fills the room as he speaks of his wife’s “sour cream apple pie with a brown sugar crumb topping” that it has got to be good. Dad and I couldn’t wait to try it. My oh my this one really is good, and easy to make too. Big thanks to Jean and George Rosenfeld for sharing with us one of their favorite recipes. (Can you tell it’s apple season here?)\n
649	Lasagna Bolognese	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrepare the Bolognese Meat Sauce\n\n1 Make the soffritto. Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold.\n2 Add the beef, pork, sausage to the soffritto, and increase the heat to high; cook until browned. Sprinkle with the clove, cinnamon, and pepper.\n\n3 Stir in tomatoes, bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.\n4 Add milk and season with sea salt. Then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.\n \nMake the Béchamel sauce.\n5 Heat the milk until almost boiling in a heavy bottomed sauce pan. In a separate pan melt the unsalted butter with the flour over low heat. Stir rapidly with a spoon. Cook this for 1 minute and then remove from the heat. (See Wikipedia on Béchamel Sauce for more information on this sauce.)\n6 Slowly add half the hot milk to your butter and flour mixture. During this process stir constantly.\n7 Return the milk, butter, flour mixture to low heat until the sauce begins to thicken. Add the remaining milk slowly while stirring working it into the thickened sauce. Continue to stir until it comes to a boil.\n8 Season with some sea salt, and continue stirring until the right consistency has developed. If any lumps form, beat them out rapidly with a whisk until they dissolve. Remove from heat.\n \nPrepare the Lasagna\n9 Preheat oven to 375°F. Cook the lasagna according to instructions. About 8 minutes in 6 quarts of boiling salted water. Drain, rinse with cold water. Lay the individual lasagna noodles out on kitchen towels, not touching, so they do not stick together while you layer the casserole.\n\n10 Spread a little olive oil around the inside of a 13x9-inch baking pan. Make sure your baking pan is non-reactive - pyrex or stainless steel. Do not use an aluminum pan as it will react with the acidity of the sauce and ruin the flavor. Put a layer of lasagna noodles down first. Layer on a third of the bolognese sauce, then a third of the bechamel sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Repeat two more times. Top with a final layer of noodles and sprinkle with grated Parmesan.\n11 Tent the casserole with aluminum foil. Put lasagna into the middle rack of a pre-heated 375°F oven. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until the top begins to get lightly browned. Remove from oven and let cool 5-10 minutes before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This isn’t a quick and easy lasagna. This is a slow and divine lasagna. A memorable lasagna. And we have a reader of Simply Recipes to thank for it. Several months ago a commenter on this site, by the name of “El Cocinero Loco” (The Crazy Cook) left a detailed and delightful lasagna Bolognese recipe in the comments of one of our recipes. The recipe given was a little incomplete; I had to fill in the blanks by referring to a few cookbooks. But it sounded so good that we just had to try it. Yes it takes hours, and yes, it is worth it. Mr. Loco’s commentary is quite amusing, so I do encourage you to read it (just scroll down the comments on this page).\n
650	Stuffed Herbed Chicken with Boursin Cheese	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Preheat oven to 350°F.  Put each chicken breast half between two layers of plastic wrap, on a chopping board, and use a meat mallet to pound until 1/4-inch thick.\n\n2 Dip each basil (or other bitter green) leaf in boiling water, drain and set aside.\n\n3 If you are not starting with Boursin herbed cheese, make your own by mixing together the Herbed Cheese ingredients mentioned above.  Mix the walnuts into the cheese mixture, set aside.\n\n4 Lay the chicken breasts flat, season each side with salt and pepper.  Spread the cheese-walnut mixture over each breast, covering the surface of the breasts.  Layer on the basil leaves.  Starting at the shortest end of the chicken breast, roll up as tightly as possible and tuck in the ends to form a neat roll.  Secure each breast with 2 toothpicks.\n\n5 Put flour, beaten egg, and bread crumbs combined with the Parmesan cheese on to 3 separate flat dishes.  Dredge each chicken breast roll first in the flour, then the egg, and finally the Parmesan bread crumbs.  (Skip this step if you are going low carb and/or gluten-free.)\n\n6 Transfer chicken breasts to a greased baking dish, seam side down.  Bake  at 350°F for 40-50 minutes, depending on the size of the breast, until the internal temperature is 165°F, the juices run clear, and the chicken is slightly browned.\n\nLet rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recently my father was inspired to make chicken breasts stuffed with Boursin cheese from a recipe he found online. If you are unfamiliar with Boursin cheese, it is essentially an all natural soft cow’s milk cheese dressed up with garlic and herbs. You can easily make your own herbed cheese with cream cheese and herbs; using something like Boursin saves a step. Kalyn of Kalyn’s Kitchen has a similar stuffed chicken recipe which inspired me to add a Parmesan bread crumb crust to this one. Either way, with the crust or without, the stuffed chicken with those herbs and the cheese is quite tasty. (Skip the crust if you are going low carb.)\n
651	Apple Turnovers	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put oven rack in lower third of oven and pre-heat oven to 400°F.  Butter a large baking sheet (or use Silpat).\n\n2 In a medium bowl, mix together apples, currants, and walnuts with the sugar, cinnamon, and corn starch, making sure the fruit and nuts are well coated.  Mix in the apple sauce and vanilla.\n\n3a Unfold the thawed pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.  Depending on the size of your puff pastry sheet you are going to want to cut the sheet into either four 5-inch-by-5-inch or six 4-inch-by-4-inch squares.  \n\n3b Roll out your pie dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x11 inch rectangle.  Trim the edges to 15x10 inches and cut into six 5x5-inch squares.\n\n4 Divide the apple mixture among the squares, leaving a 1-inch border.  If you are using an already prepared puff pastry sheet, dot the mixture in each pastry with a little butter. (If you are using a butter pie dough, you can skip adding the extra butter.)  In a small bowl mix the beaten egg with a teaspoon of milk.  Use a pastry brush to brush the egg mixture on the border of the pastry.\n\n\n\n5 Fold each pastry into a triangle, enclosing the filling, and crimp edges with a fork.  Brush the tops of the pastries with more of the egg wash.  Cut 2 or 3 small steam vents in the top of each turnover.\n\n6 Place the pastries in the oven and bake at 400°F for 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden.\n\nCool turnovers to warm before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	With apple turnovers, the biggest decision one needs to make is how to do the pastry crust. If you use an already prepared frozen puff pastry or folded pie crust, the apple turnovers will be a snap to make, they will look pretty, and the crust may be acceptable, but probably nothing to write home about. If you use a homemade butter crust (pâte brisée) which is really not so hard to make, your pastry will taste wonderful, and may even be flaky, but not filled with puffy layers. If you make your own homemade puff pastry dough, which requires technique and steps beyond a simple homemade pie dough, you will have a truly delicious and gorgeous pastry. Since I have yet to master this last technique, I am obliged to use either a homemade butter pie crust, or a frozen prepared puff pastry sheet. I’ve made apple turnovers with both, and I can say that the homemade butter crust is light years better than the frozen puff pastry, but is obviously a bit more work. So, what I have here is a recipe that calls for either using a frozen puff pastry sheet or homemade pâte brisée dough.\nThe inside of these apple turnovers include apples, of course, but also dried currants, walnuts, apple sauce, a little sugar and cinnamon, and a dash of vanilla.\n
652	Caprese Mini Sandwiches	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 425ºF. Place flatbread rounds on a pizza stone or baking pan; drizzle with oil, spreading evenly. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan cheese and seasoning mix. Bake 8-10 minutes or until edges are light golden brown and cheese is melted.\n2 While the flatbread is toasting, create a light pesto by mixing together in a small bowl the walnuts, fresh basil, garlic and salt.\n3 Remove flatbread from the oven to a cutting board. Turn the pieces over. Drizzle with dressing, spreading evenly to the edges. Using a sharp chef's knife, cut each round into six wedges. Top each wedge with a small amount of the greens. Place one slice of mozzarella cheese over greens; top with pesto and one slice of tomato. Top with remaining pita wedges, cheese side up forming 12 mini sandwiches. Serve immediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father would call these sandwiches for “ladies who lunch”, and in fact, I first encountered them at a luncheon gathering of women friends. But one can’t really go wrong with lightly toasted flatbread and an insalata Caprese filling of tomatoes, fresh mozarella, and basil. The original recipe comes from a friend’s Pampered Chef recipe; the following, my adaptation.\n
653	Old Fashioned Apple Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a food processor, combine flour, almonds, salt and brown sugar, pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with pea size pieces of butter. Add water 1 Tablespoon at a time, pulsing until mixture just begins to clump together. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready, if not, add a little more water and pulse again.  \n\nRemove dough from machine and place on a clean surface. Carefully shape into 2 discs. Do not over-knead the dough! You should still be able to see little bits of butter in the dough. These bits of butter are what will allow the result crust to be flaky. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.\n\n2 Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375°F.\n\n3 Combine sugar, flour and spices in large bowl. Use your hands and mix in the apples so they are well coated, then add brandy and vanilla extract.\n\n4 Remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Sprinkle some flour on top of the disk.  Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12 inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick.  As you roll out the dough, use a metal spatula to check if the dough is sticking to the surface below.  Add a few sprinkles of flour if necessary to keep the dough from sticking.  Gently fold in half. Place on to a 9-inch pie plate, lining up the fold with the center of the pan.  Gently unfold and press down to line the pie dish with the dough. \n\n5 Spoon in apple filling, mounding slightly in center.\n\n6 Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently turn over onto the top of the apples in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold dough under itself so that the edge of the fold is flush with the edge of the pan. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.  \n\n7 Stir yolk and cream in small bowl to blend. Brush over top of pie. Cut slits in top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake pie until crust begins to turn golden, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F.  Tent the rims with aluminum foil or a pie protector if the edges are browning too quickly.  Bake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, anywhere from an additional 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the type of apples you are using.   Transfer to rack; let stand 1 hour. Serve pie warm or at room temperature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s that time of year again, apple season. Our trees are practically raining Granny Smiths. In anticipation of a long apple season we have begun to experiment with apple pies; this recipe is our current favorite. What makes it special are two things: 1) an all butter homemade crust with some ground up almonds (I used a blender to chop up blanched almonds) added to the flour, and 2) including a little brandy and vanilla to the filling, along with the traditional spices. The trick is when to pull the pie out. The cooking time will vary a bit, depending on the apples you are using. Granny Smiths cook up pretty quickly, Gravensteins, longer. So look for a nice browned crust and you should be able to look through the venting slits to see the filling bubbling. Homemade crusts can be a challenge if you aren’t used to making them. See the following recipes for more detailed instructions: Perfect Pie Crust and All Butter Crust with Almonds.\n
654	Onion Rings	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the buttermilk (or yogurt and milk) with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a large bowl. Add the onions to the buttermilk mixture and coat thoroughly. Let sit at least 15 minutes.\n2 In a separate bowl combine the flour and cornmeal, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Set aside.\n3 Add the oil to a largish Dutch oven pan - about 5-quart or 6 quart size. Make sure that the pan is absolutely dry inside before you add the oil. Any water droplets in the pan will cause the oil to splatter violently as it heats up. The oil should create a layer anywhere from 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Use more oil if necessary. Heat the oil to 350°F. Use a candy thermometer to measure the heat of the oil. You may need to tilt the pan in order to cover the thermometer's sensor completely and get an accurate reading. I have found some instant-read thermometers to be useless for this purpose as their sensors are 2 1/2 inches up from the bottom. A good old fashioned metal-encased thermometer works best.\nBe very careful whenever handling hot oil. No running kids in the kitchen. No distractions. Do not answer the phone if it rings. Pay attention. Have the pan's lid close by.\nYou can test if the oil is ready by moistening a little bit of the flour and dropping it in the pan. If it sizzles and fries, it's ready. If it burns, take the pan off the heat and let the oil cool down a bit.\n\n4 Working in batches, lift some onion rings out of the buttermilk and coat them in the flour mixture. Use tongs to place them one by one in the hot oil. Fry for a minute on each side, until golden brown. Do not crowd them. Place finished onion rings on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Keep the complete onion rings warm in a 200°F oven while you fry the rest. Between batches, if you end up needing more oil, add some. Let the temp get back up to 350°F before starting the next batch.\nServe hot.\nNote: It's best not to pour the leftover oil down the drain. Better to pour into an extra empty jar, and discard with your trash.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When I was a kid growing up in Los Angeles, my grandmother used to take me to the farmers market in Miracle Mile. After the market, we would walk over to Bob’s Big Boy and order a serving of fried onion rings. We probably ordered hamburgers too, but all I remember to this day was how much I loved those onion rings. As far as I knew at age five or six, Bob’s was the only place on the planet to get them.\nI still love onion rings, but can’t eat so many of those heavily battered, deep fried ones. This recipe, adapted from one by Ina Garten in a recent issue of Oprah Magazine makes a lighter onion ring than I remember from Bob’s, but still crunchy and delicious.\n
655	Bell Pepper Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine all ingredients into a small bowl.  Serve with steak, carnitas, or carne asada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Salsa pictured over grilled tri tip steak.\nSalsa doesn’t have to be made with tomatoes, nor does it even need fresh chiles. A quick and easy, delicious salsa to make to accompany steak and meat dishes is a bell pepper salsa, seasoned with red chile flakes, onions, and parsley, basil or arugula.\n
656	Stuffed Zucchini with Ham and Mushrooms	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Wash and scrub the zucchini; split each in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the seeds and pulp, leaving shells about 1/3-inch to 1/2-inch thick.  \n\n2 Steam the zucchini halves until almost tender, about 8-12 minutes, depending on the size of the zucchini.  Note that for a jumbo zucchini, you'll need to get a little creative with the steaming, as the halves won't fit in a normal steamer.  I steamed mine in a fish poacher.  You could put a large zucchini on a rack in a roasting pan over half and inch of boiling water, cover it with aluminum foil and cook it in a hot oven until almost tender.\n\n\n\n3   While the zucchini is steaming, melt 3 Tbsp of butter in a large sauté pan, add the chopped onions and sliced mushrooms, sauté until soft.  Stir in the ham, parsley, Worcestershire sauce.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne.  Pile the stuffing into well-drained zucchini shells.\n\n4 Mix the bread crumbs and grated cheese together and sprinkle over the stuffed zucchini.  Melt 1 Tbsp of butter and drip over the bread crumbs.  Place the zucchini boats in a greased baking pan; bake at 350°F until toasted on top and heated through, 20-30 minutes.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Starting in September around here, people who grow zucchini in their garden begin to discover super-sized zukes that somehow missed getting picked earlier and just kept on growing. My mother’s friend Claire gave us such a monster zucchini from her garden this week – 14 inches long, and weighing at least a couple of pounds. Fortunately for us, she also included her favorite stuffed zucchini recipe, tried and true. Mushrooms, onions, ham and butter – yes, it was fabulous. Thank you Claire!\n
657	Savory Chicken Drummettes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse and pat dry drummettes, place in a large, non-reactive bowl, or leak-proof plastic bag.  Mix together garlic, honey, mustard, soy sauce, lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper for marinade.  Pour marinade over chicken drummettes and make sure each piece is well coated.  Refrigerate for at least one hour and up to one day.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Place chicken in a single layer on a wire rack set over an oven tray lined with aluminum foil.  Bake 25-35 minutes (depending on the size of your chicken drummettes) until well browned and cooked through.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father has had his thinking cap on. “It’s football season. What your website readers need is something good to eat while drinking beer and watching the game.” He’s so right, isn’t he? I love good finger food. In dad’s newly ordained role as EVP of Research and Development for Simply Recipes, he sought out and found a great recipe for chicken drummettes – the part of a chicken wing that looks like a mini drumstick. The recipe comes from Petaluma Poultry, providers of Rocky Range and Rocky Jr. chickens. You don’t have to use only drummettes, you can use wingettes or just pieces of chicken, cut the size of drummette. Note that cooking time will vary with different cuts. These were absolutely delicious; we can’t wait for dad to make them again.\n
669	Poached Egg and Bacon Salad – Salad Lyonnaise	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook two strips of bacon on medium heat until done, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, let drain of excess fat on a paper towel. Once cool, chop.\n2 Cut a slice of French or Italian bread into cubes. Toast on medium high heat in a small saucepan with a teaspoon of melted butter. Do not stir bread unless to turn to a different side once one side is toasted.\n3 Poach egg your favorite way. See how to poach an egg for our recommendation on the easiest way to do it.\n4 Layer the frisée, bacon, shallots, and croutons on a salad plate. In a small jar, mix the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper. Pour dressing over salad. Top with the poached egg.\nDevour.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I saw a tasty salad on Ben Trott’s Vox page and just had to make it. It is a traditional French salad, called Salad Lyonnaise, made with frisée or curly endive, hot bacon, and a freshly poached egg. Not one to have torn up bread with it when one could easily make buttered croutons, I made some croutons for it as well. Okay, bacon, eggs, and buttered croutons and it counts as a salad? I inhaled it.\n
660	Rustic Onion Tart	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If you are making a crust from scratch, prepare the dough and let it chill in the refrigerator while you are cooking the onions.\n2 Peel and slice the onions, lengthwise from stem to root. (See How to Slice an Onion)\n\n3 Heat olive oil and butter in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned. Add balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.\n4 Preheat the oven to 450°F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5 minutes before rolling it out. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10-inch diameter. Remove the crust dough to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.\n\n5 Place all but a couple tablespoons of the cheese in the center of the dough. Spread to within 1 1/2 inches from the edges. Add the caramelized onions, layering them on top of the cheese. Fold the edges of the crust dough over so that a small circle of onion is still showing in the centre of the tart. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the tart.\n6 Place in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 10 minutes at 450°F. Reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I recently observed my friend Suzanne whip up a couple onion tarts for a family meal and was so impressed by the wonderful flavor of the caramelized onion, I decided to try my hand at it. I’ve deviated a bit from Suzanne’s recipe, and have followed some tips from Helen of Beyond Salmon who has a lovely tomato onion tart posted on her site to come up with the following recipe. We all loved it. Making an onion tart may a little involved, but if you are using a packaged frozen crust (use the flat or folded kind), it’s very easy. Caramelizing the onions takes an hour, but you don’t have to stir them that often. However, if you are making a crust from scratch, as I am prone to do, well, that’s a whole other level of complexity and of course, rewards.\n
661	Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Bacon and Pear	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1.  Heat a cast iron skillet to medium high heat.  Layer your sandwich - bread slice, cheese, pear slices, bacon, bread slice.  Spread butter over the top of the sandwich.  Place the sandwich top side down (butter side down) on the hot pan.  Butter the exposed side of the sandwich.  Let cook for a minute and then use a metal spatula to turn the sandwich over to its other side.\n\n\n\n2 While you are toasting the sandwich on the remaining side, press down on the sandwich with a spatula.  Alternatively, you can mimic a panini press (albeit without the ridges) by heating a smaller cast iron pan on a separate burner.  Use the weight of this pan to press down on the sandwich from above.\n\nThe sandwich is done when the sides are toasted and the cheese is melted.  Cut in half and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A few months ago I had the pleasure of accompanying Amy of Cooking with Amy and Brett of In Praise of Sardines for a light bite to eat at the Arlequin deli in Hayes Valley, San Francisco. Amy highly recommended the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and pear, and it was, true to Amy’s suggestion, fabulous. The sweet pear worked beautifully with the bacon and sharp cheddar. A great combination. Bartlett pears are just now finally making a show at the markets and I made these sandwiches for the family this week. We also tried them with ham, in place of the bacon. The bacon won. There is a debate here as to whether gruyere would do well in place of the cheddar. “No, no, no, it would overwhelm the pear.” We haven’t tried that combo yet, but if you do, please let us know how it goes.\n
662	Garlic Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod 1 - Toasted\n\n1 Preheat oven to 350°F.\n\n\n\n2 Cut the bread in half, horizontally.  Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small bowl. Spread butter mixture over the the two bread halves.  Place on a sturdy baking pan (one that can handle high temperatures, not a cookie sheet) and heat in the oven for 10 minutes.\n\n3  Remove pan from oven.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over bread if you want.  Return to oven on the highest rack.  Broil on high heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the bread begin to toast and the cheese (if you are using cheese) bubbles.  Watch very carefully while broiling.  The bread can easily go from un-toasted to burnt.\n\n4 Remove from oven, let cool a minute.  Remove from pan and make 1-inch thick slices.  Serve immediately.\n\nMethod 2 - Soft\n\n\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F.  Make the butter, garlic, parsley mixture as above.  Make 1-inch thick slices into the bread, but do not go all the way through, just to the bottom crust.  Put a teaspoon or two of the butter mixture between each slice.  Wrap the bread in aluminum foil and heat for 15 minutes in the oven.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Spaghetti just seems lonely without garlic bread, and it’s so easy to make. There are several methods and twists for making garlic bread, the most simple being just rubbing a cut clove of garlic over slices of Italian or French bread, spreading the bread with butter and heating in the oven. Here are a couple of methods that make wonderful garlic bread, depending on how you like it, either toasty or soft.\n
663	Italian Sausage Spaghetti	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Sauce:\nTake the Italian sausage meat out of the sausage casings. Break up into pieces and mix the sweet and spicy sausage meats together. Brown the sausage meat in a large skillet on medium high or high heat with a little olive oil. In a separate skillet sauté the onions and garlic until the onions are translucent. Purée the tomatoes in a blender, add to the skillet with the sausage meat. Add the cooked onions and garlic.\nThe Pasta\nFill an 8-quart or larger stock pot at least half full with water and bring to a rolling boil. Add a tablespoon of salt. Slowly add the pasta, stirring to prevent clumping. Allow the water to come to a rolling boil again. Cook, uncovered, with a fairly vigorous boil, for as long as the directions on the pasta package say, usually about 10-12 minutes. When pasta is al dente (cooked but still a little firm), remove the pot from the heat. Add a cup or two of cold water to the pasta to stop the cooking. Drain the water from the pasta through a colander. Place the pasta in a serving bowl.\nServe immediately. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My parents have been making spaghetti this way for several years, ever since first learning about this method from watching a Martha Stewart program. Martha apparently got it from some famous chef in New York City. The beauty of this spaghetti recipe is that it is very easy to make and you don’t have to add any seasoning to achieve wonderful flavor. The sauce gets all of its seasoning from two Italian sausages – one sweet, one spicy.\n\n\n
1013	Rabbit Cacciatore	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\n1 Sprinkle the rabbit pieces generously with salt and pepper.  Rub half of the thyme leaves into the pieces, then sprinkle with flour to lightly coat. Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium high.  Place the rabbit pieces in the pan in a single layer.  Do not stir.  Cook for 2-3 minutes on one side until lightly browned, then turn the pieces and brown on the other side for a minute or two more.   Remove the rabbit pieces to a dish to set aside.\n\n2 Reduce heat to medium.  Add onions to the pan, cook for 1 minute.  Then add garlic, bell pepper, and mushrooms, cook for a couple minutes more.  Add the rosemary and the remaining thyme.  Add the rabbit back into the pan.  Cover with chopped tomatoes and bay leaf.  Reduce heat to medium low; cover the pan and cook for 35 minutes.\n\n \n\n3 Uncover the pan, add the olives.  Increase heat to high and cook for several minutes to boil off excess moisture and reduce the sauce.  When the liquid has reduced by half, check the seasoning, add salt or pepper to taste, remove from heat and serve.\n\nServe with rice, pasta, or potatoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The first time I had rabbit, I was 19, visiting a friend’s grandparent’s ranch in Cuernavaca, Mexico. They raised rabbits, among other things, and I was asked to go outside and pick out a few from the hundreds in their pens. Not knowing why I was asked to perform this task, I picked out the cutest ones I could find. An hour later I was mortified when I went in the kitchen and saw those rabbits, skinned and sticking out of a huge steaming pot on the stove. The menu for lunch that day was rabbit stew, and we were having a feast with my friend’s extended family. White linens, silver, fine china, 20 people assembled at an impressively long dining table. Out of politeness, and my complete lack of fluency in the language (if I had been more fluent I might have found a way out of this situation) I took a bite. It was absolutely delicious. From that point on, I loved rabbit. \n \nPeople often compare the taste of rabbit to chicken. I think it has the texture of chicken, particularly of chicken thighs or legs, but it really doesn’t taste like chicken. It has its own wonderful taste. Years ago it was much more common to cook rabbit, and more easy to find it at a butcher shop. But these days, in the era of chicken and supermarkets, you likely need to go to a specialty market to find some. This rabbit recipe is an easy to make cacciatore, or a “hunter style” stew, which is typically made with either chicken or rabbit.\n
664	Corn Chowder	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the bacon strip (skip this step for vegetarian option, just add more butter) and fry until the bacon renders its fat, but doesn't begin to brown, 3 or 4 minutes.  Add the onion and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes, until soft.  Add the carrot and celery and cook for 4 or 5 more minutes.\n\n2  Break the corn cobs in half and add them to the saucepan.  Add the milk and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a bare simmer.  Cover the pot and cook for 30 minutes.  Make sure the heat is as low as can be and still maintain a gentle simmer (on our stove we had to use the "warm" setting) to prevent scalding the milk on the bottom of the pan.\n\n3 Discard the cobs, the bacon strip, and the bay leaf. Raise the heat, add the potatoes, red pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, fresh ground pepper to taste, bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost fork tender.\n\n4 Raise the heat, add the corn kernels and the thyme.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	With sweet, fresh corn, still available at the local farmers market, we just couldn’t resist trying our hands at some fresh corn chowder. The recipe is adapted from one by Mitchell Davis in Kitchen Sense and is full of flavor. The original recipe calls for a strip of bacon, but you can add a little bacon fat instead, if you have some on hand, or just add a little more butter.\n
665	Creamy Polenta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat water lightly seasoned with salt to a boil over high heat, about 5 minutes. Quickly whisk in the polenta until fully incorporated.2 Lower the heat to a low simmer, add the butter and allow the polenta to cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.3 Finish by stirring in the cream cheese and salt to taste.\nIf preparing in advance, cool, cover and refrigerate. Reheat in the microwave, about 5 minutes on high, just before serving. Stir vigorously after reheating to fluff.\nServes 8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The simplicity of this creamy polenta recipe belies its true wonderfulness. This polenta is so light, so fluffy, so creamy, it could almost be a dessert. Polenta is made from coarsely ground cornmeal and is a staple of Northern Italy. It makes a wonderful serving base for osso bucco, short ribs or oxtail. In this recipe the polenta is slowly cooked in water with a little butter, then finished with stirring in some cream cheese and salt. Easy to make and absolutely delicious.\n
666	Fresh Basil Pesto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the basil in with the pine nuts, pulse a few times in a food processor. (If you are using walnuts instead of pine nuts and they are not already chopped, pulse them a few times first, before adding the basil.) Add the garlic and cheese and pulse a few times more.\n2 Slowly add the olive oil in a constant stream while the food processor is on. Stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula. Add a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\nServe with pasta, or over baked potatoes, or spread over toasted baguette slices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every year we plant basil and every year the plants do so well that we can’t use it up fast enough. What to do? Basil pesto, of course! Here is a simple recipe. Note that pesto is always made to taste, based on the ingredients at hand. So adjust the ingredients to your taste. Most pesto recipes call for Parmesan cheese, we often use Romano which has a stronger flavor. Most basil pesto recipes call for pine nuts but you can easily substitute walnuts.\nIf you want to freeze the pesto you make, omit the cheese (it doesn’t freeze well). Line an ice cube tray with plastic wrap, and fill each pocket with the pesto. Freeze and then remove from the ice tray and store in a freezer bag. When you want to use, defrost and add in grated Parmesan or Romano.\n
667	Cranberry Apple Stuffed Pork Loin	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 325°F. \n\n\n\n2 Rinse the pork and pat it dry.  Butterfly the roast by first cutting lengthwise about halfway through the roast.  Then angle the knife and cut horizontally almost all of the way through, on both sides.  Unfold the pork and cut tiny slits in the surface of the meat.  Cover with 2 layers of of plastic wrap.  Pound with a meat mallet to flatten as much as possible.  Remove plastic wrap.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper and set aside.\n\n\n\n3 Place croutons and stock in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes, until the croutons have absorbed the stock and have softened.  Mash up the croutons a bit with a fork.  Stir in the apples, walnuts, cranberries, shallots, maple syrup and rosemary.  Spread mixture over surface of the pork.  Starting with the smallest side of the meat (which should be in the shape of a rectangle), roll up tightly and secure with kitchen string. At this point you can wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate if you are making ahead.\n\n4 Coat the bottom of a roasting pan with cooking spray or a little olive oil.  Place the roast in the pan and cook at 325°F, uncovered, for about 1 hour ten minutes, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 140-145°F.  Start checking the internal temperature of the roast at about one hour.  Let stand for 10 minutes.  Remove the kitchen string and slice into 1/2-inch thick slices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	September has arrived and with it, hints of fall, ripening apples, and kids everywhere going back to school. We found this recipe in a local grocery circular and just happened to have a pork roast in the freezer longing to be eaten. The stuffing ingredients – croutons, apple, walnuts, cranberries, shallots, maple syrup and rosemary – worked well together, as one would expect looking at that list, and added a lovely fall dimension to the roast.\n
668	Chiffon Pumpkin Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrust:\n\nSet the oven at 325°F.  Have on hand a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan.  Butter it lightly.\n\nIn a bowl, combine the crushed gingersnaps, sugar, ginger, and butter.  Press the mixture into the pie plate with the back of a spoon, making the top edge even all around.  Bake the crust for 8-15 minutes, until it is lightly browned (baking time depends on the oven and on the type of pie dish you are using - a ceramic dish will take longer because it takes longer to heat up).\n\nFilling:\n\nIn a heavy-based saucepan, combine the gelatin, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, milk, and egg yolks.  Stir thoroughly.  Set the pan over medium heat and cook gently, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly.  Do not let it boil!\n\nRemove the mixture from the heat and let it cool.  Add the pumpkin purée and the rum.  Refrigerate the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it thickens enough to form mounds.\n\nIn an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and granulated sugar until the form stiff peaks.  Stir a few spoonfuls of the egg whites into the pumpkin mixture, then fold in the remaining whites.  (If you are concerned about eating raw egg whites, use egg white substitute, dried egg whites, that you can find in the grocery store.)\n\nPour the filling into the cooled crust. Refrigerate for several hours.\n\nJust before serving, spoon the whipped cream onto the filling and garnish with crushed ginger snaps.  Cut the pie into wedges.\n\n*To make pumpkin purée, cut a sugar pumpkin in half, scoop out the seeds, lie face down on a tin-foil lined baking pan.  Bake at 350°F until soft, about 45 min to an hour.  Cool, scoop out the flesh.  Freeze whatever you don't use for future use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If you are looking for a special pie for the holidays, this is it – a light pumpkin pie with beaten egg whites folded into the pumpkin custard, spiked with rum, set in a gingersnap cookie crust, and covered with whipped cream. The recipe comes from my friend Heidi who pulled it from the Boston Globe a few years ago. And as they say in New England, it’s wicked good. \n
670	Mint Chocolate Pudding Cakes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F. Generously butter six 3/4-cup (6 ounce) ramekins. Cut the butter into pieces and heat the chocolate with the butter in small, thick-bottomed saucepan over low heat, stirring, until melted and smooth. Remove the pan from the burner and let cool slightly.\n\n2 With an electric mixer, beat the eggs, egg yolks, and the sugar until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and beat until incorporated. Add the chocolate mixture, the peppermint extract, and the salt. Beat just until incorporated. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet. \n\n3 Bake the cakes until the edges are set but the centers look shiny and still wiggle like jello when the ramekins are lightly shaken, 10-11 minutes. (Start checking at 9 minutes.) Remove the cakes from oven; let cool for 5-10 minutes.\n\nEither serve as is, in the ramekins, or run a knife around the edges of the cakes and invert on to individual dessert plates.  \n\nServe with raspberries, mint leaves, vanilla or mint ice cream, or whipped cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I was recently invited to lead a cooking session with a Girl Scout troop. For days the hostess and I deliberated on what to cook. We finally settled on these luxurious chocolate pudding cakes, because 1) they’re easy to make, 2) they could be prepped, cooked, and eaten in the allotted time (about an hour), and 3) everyone loves chocolate. The recipe is from Bon Appétit magazine. The cakes are generally inverted and served with ice cream, which is how I first enjoyed them at a friend’s dinner party. However, these particular pudding cakes (pictured), made with the loving care of Troop 2656, just did not want to invert (the buttering of the ramekins was probably a bit too thin). When I made them again today, they cooked almost all the way through. So, lessons learned – butter well, and make sure to keep your eye on the ramekins in the oven. Start checking at about 9 minutes. The cakes should be like mini volcanoes – cake on the outside and molten lava chocolate on the inside.\n
671	Chicken Pot Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Cook the chicken and make the chicken stock.  Combine the chicken, carrot, celery, onion and salt into a large stock pot.  Add cold water until just covered and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the pot and let cool for 15 minutes.  While the chicken is cooling, continue to boil the remaining water and vegetables in the pot.  When the chicken has cooled enough to touch, strip away as much of the meat as you can.  Place the meat on a dish, set aside.  Return the chicken bones to the stockpot and continue to boil, on high heat, until the stock has reduced to a quart or quart and a half.  Set aside 2 1/2 cups of the stock for this recipe.  The remaining stock you can refrigerate and store for another purpose.\n\n\n\n2 Prepare the pie crust dough.  Combine the flour and salt in a food processor.  Add the chilled butter cubes and pulse 5 times to combine.  And the shortening and pulse a few more times, until the dough resembles a coarse cornmeal, with some pea-sized pieces of butter.  Slowly stream in ice water, a tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition, until the dough sticks together when you press some between your fingers.  Empty the food processor, placing the dough on a clean surface.  Use your hands to mold into a ball, then flatten the ball into a disk.  Sprinkle with a little flour, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 days, before rolling.\n\n\n\n3 Prepare the filling.  Preheat oven to 400°F.  In a large skillet, melt butter on medium heat.  Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, one minute more.  Whisk in 2 1/2 cups of the chicken stock.  Whisk in the milk.  Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add the chicken meat, thyme, sherry, peas, parsley, salt and pepper and stir well.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.  Divide the warm filling among six 10-ounce ramekins.\n\n\n\n4 Prepare the crust.  Roll out dough on a lightly flour surface to a little less than a quarter-inch thick.  Cut into 6 rounds, slightly larger than the circumference of the ramekins.  Lay a dough round on each pot pie filling.  Fold the excess dough under itself and use the tines of a fork to press the dough against the edge of the ramekins.  Cut a 1-inch vent into each individual pie.  Use a pastry brush to apply an egg wash to each pie.  Line a baking sheet with foil, place the pies on the baking sheet.  Bake at 400°F for 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbling.  Let cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father’s childhood friends Dick and Doris came to visit us last week from Chicago (by train!) and brought the most wonderful gift – a copy of the Marshall Field’s Cookbook (sometimes available on eBay), from the famed Chicago department store (recently bought out by Macy’s). The book has a photo of the store’s famous “Mrs. Hering’s Chicken Pot Pie” on the cover, so tempting, we had to try it. If you are looking for an old fashioned, traditional chicken pot pie, made from a whole chicken, freshly cut vegetables, and a flaky homemade crust, this is it (with a few minor adjustments to the original recipe). \n
672	Spicy Pumpkin Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Melt butter in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes.  Add spices and stir for a minute more.\n\n2 Add pumpkin and 5 cups of chicken broth; blend well.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat, simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  \n\n3 Transfer soup, in batches, to a blender or food processor.  Cover tightly and blend until smooth.  Return soup to saucepan.\n\n4 With the soup on low heat, add brown sugar and mix.  Slowly add milk while stirring to incorporate.  Add cream.  Adjust seasonings to taste.  If a little too spicy, add more cream to cool it down.  You might want to add a teaspoon of salt.\n\nServe in individual bowls.  Sprinkle the top of each with toasted pumpkin seeds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I love pumpkin soup, don’t you? This recipe is adapted from one featured in Oprah Magazine. The original called for the soup to be served in roasted carved-out sugar pumpkins – a nice touch, but a little overkill for my taste. Helping with the cooking were my young friends Alden and Reilly. We all agreed that the original recipe was a little too spicy, so we added some heavy cream and some brown sugar and it turned out just perfect. \n
673	Braised Beef Short Ribs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Season ribs to taste with the salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed ovenproof pan over high heat.  Add ribs and brown on all sides.  Work in batches if you need to so that the ribs don't get crowded (this will help with browning).\n\n2 Transfer ribs to a plate.  Pour off excess fat.  Add the onions, celery, and carrots to the pan and sauté, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pan, set aside.  Then add the wine to the pan, deglazing the pan, scraping off any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Reduce the wine by three-quarters until thick and slightly syrupy, about 15 minutes.  \n\n3 Return the ribs to the pan, add the veal stock and enough water to cover the ribs.  Bring to a boil, cover with foil, and place in the oven.  Braise, cooking in the oven, until the meat is fork-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. During the last 1/2 hour of cooking, add back in the vegetables. Allow the ribs to cool in the liquid, then cover and refrigerate overnight.\n\n4 The next day, remove the excess fat that has solidified at the top from the overnight chilling.  Place the pan with the ribs and cooking liquid over medium heat, uncovered.  Cook until the liquid has reduced by three-quarters, about 1 hour.  Continue to cook, spooning the sauce over the ribs, until the sauce is thick and ribs are glazed.  Take care not to burn the glaze; move the ribs around in the pan to keep them from burning.\n\nServe over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father made the most succulent, tender, “Wow” beef short ribs this week. Yes, it is a 2 day process, but the actual hands-on cooking time is at most two hours, and is broken up over two days. It is really quite easy to make. The key step is after the initial slow cooking, to let the ribs cool and then chill overnight in the refrigerator. This makes it much easier to remove the generous amount of excess fat that ends up solidifying in the chilling process. The beef ribs also spend the whole night absorbing the flavor of the stock. You must use a good bottle of wine, the better the wine, the better the result. Veal stock can be hard to find, we got ours at our local butcher. Use it if you can get it, if not, beef stock will do. The recipe on which this dish is based came from the Campton Place restaurant in San Francisco. (We found it in a magazine years ago, but we can’t identify which magazine from the clipping.) \n
679	Sherry Potatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F.\n\n2 Arrange potato slices in layers in a gratin pan or baking pan, sprinkling salt and pepper over each layer.  Pour sherry over the potatoes.  Pour the melted butter over the potatoes.  Make sure the potatoes are well coated.\n\n3 Bake uncovered for 30-40 minutes or until potatoes are cooked, but not mushy, and they are slightly browned on top.  Remove from oven, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We recently had sherry potatoes (potato slices baked in sherry and butter) at Selland’s, our favorite local cafe. They were so good that we spent many tries attempting to recreate them in our kitchen. I scoured the Internet looking for a recipe but only came up with some German sites that mentioned sherry potatoes, but no recipe. We have, however, finally arrived at a method that works, and recreates the divine potatoes we enjoy so much at the cafe. It’s very simple, baking sliced potatoes in butter and dry sherry, salting generously, and sprinkling on a little parsley. The dry sherry truly enhances the flavor of the butter.\n
674	Caramel Apples	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Combine sugar, butter, condensed milk, corn syrup, maple syrup, vanilla, molasses and salt in a thick-bottomed 2 1/2 or 3 quart saucepan.  Stir with a wooden spoon on medium-low heat until all the sugar dissolves.  There should be no grittiness (sugar crystals) when you test by rubbing a little of the caramel between your fingers.  Brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to dissolve any sugar crystals that might form on the pan sides. \n\n\n\n2 Attach a clip-on candy thermometer to the pan and cook caramel at a rolling boil until the thermometer reaches 236°F, stirring constantly and slowly with a wooden spatula.  Continue to occasionally brush the sides down with a pastry brush.  Carefully pour caramel into a metal bowl.  Cool until the temperature lowers to 200°F, at which point you are ready to dip the apples.\n\n\n\n3  While the caramel is cooking/cooling, prepare a large baking sheet, covering it either with buttered aluminum foil or silpat.  Insert a chopstick or sturdy lollipop stick into  each apple, about 2-inches, top down, into the apple core.  \n\n4 When the caramel has cooled enough for dipping, dip the apples in, one by one, by holding on to the stick, and vertically lowering the apple into the caramel, submerging all but the very top of the apple.  Pull the apple up from the caramel and let the excess caramel drip off from the bottom back into the pan.  Then place on the silpat or prepared foil.  The caramel will pool a little at the bottom of each apple.  Place into the refrigerator to chill for at least 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n5 Once the caramel has chilled a bit, remove from the refrigerator and use your fingers to press the caramel that has dripped to the bottom of the apples, back on to the apples.  Then take whatever coatings you want and press them into the apples for decoration.  Return to the refrigerator to chill for at least one hour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Caramel candy apples are one of those things that are as much fun to make as they are to eat. I helped out at a young friend’s birthday party this week, making up a batch of these caramel apples for a flock of kids. (Original recipe from Epicurious.) Of note, none of the kids went for the pecan topping (what’s up with kids not liking nuts?), they preferred the M&Ms, raisins, and candy sprinkles. Each got to dip his or her own apple and decorate it.\n
675	Spicy Lamb Stew with Butternut Squash	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper on the meat.  In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 Tbsp of the olive oil.  Add the meat and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until all the juices evaporate, about 7 minutes.  Add the onion and cook stirring, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.\n\n2 Add the tomato paste, 1 Tbsp of paprika and 1/8 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Cook, stirring until the mixture begins to carmelize.  Add 1 1/2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to a low simmer, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 45 minutes.\n\n3 Add the squash, garbanzo beans, tomato, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and enough water to just cover the ingredients.  Cover and cook until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.\n\n4 Stir in the lemon juice and remove from the heat.  Season with salt.  Transfer the stew to a shallow serving dish.\n\n5 Rub the 2 teaspoons of paprika, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and dried mint through a fine sieve. In a small saucepan, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil on medium heat, until a speck of spice dropped into the oil sizzles.  Add the sieved spices and stir for just an instant.  Swirl the seasoned oil into the stew, stir once and serve hot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	With shorter days and colder nights, this richly flavorful lamb stew with butternut squash is a great way to fill up and stay warm.\n
676	Apple Chicken Quesadilla	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat a large skillet on medium high heat.  Place one tortilla in the skillet.  Flip it a couple of times with a spatula, then let it sit in the pan heating up until air pockets form and parts of the tortilla begin to puff up.  Flip it again.\n\n\n\n2 Place cheese slices on half of the tortilla, at least 1/2-inch from the edge of the tortilla.  Add chicken pieces on top of the cheese.  Fold the tortilla over like an omelette, and press down on the folded tortilla with the spatula.  Lower the heat to medium.  At this point, if you have enough room in your skillet, you can add a second tortilla to the pan to begin to heat it up.\n\n\n\n3 When the cheese inside the quesadilla has melted, remove the quesadilla to a cutting board.  Open it wide and layer on apple slices and salsa.  Fold the tortilla back again, and cut it into 3 triangles, as if you were cutting a pie. (You don't have to cut the quesadilla into triangles, it just makes it easier for kids to eat.)\n\n4 Repeat with the remaining tortillas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I was charged with providing lunch for several kids (ages 4, 6, 7, and 9) a few days ago and prepared for them one of my favorite quickie lunches – chicken and apple quesadillas. The kids gobbled them up, and one of them, Teddy, exclaimed loudly after the first one, “Elise, you HAVE to put these on your website!” The others nodded in agreement, while busily chomping away. So for all you quesadilla-loving kids out there, here you go.\n
677	Baked Apples	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Wash apples.  Remove cores to 1/2 inch of the bottom of the apples.  It helps if you have an apple corer, but if not, you can use a paring knife to cut out first the stem area, and then the core.  Use a spoon to dig out the seeds.  Make the holes about 3/4-inch to an inch wide.\n\n2 In a small bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, currants/raisins, and pecans.  Place apples in a 8-inch-by-8-inch square baking pan.  Stuff each apple with this mixture.  Top with a dot of butter (1/4 of the Tbps).  \n\n3 Add boiling water to the baking pan.  Bake 30-40 minutes, until tender, but not mushy.  Remove from the oven and baste the apples several times with the pan juices.\n\nServe warm with vanilla icecream on the side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s apple season here in New England, where I am visiting my goddaughter and her family. We went apple picking a few days ago and came home with so many apples, we’ll be cooking with them all week. Today the girls helped me make baked apples, a childhood favorite, with some lovely Rome Beauties we picked. The following recipe is based on an old recipe from the Joy of Cooking, with the addition of pecans and chopped raisins. Growing up we always had baked apples served with a generous portion of vanilla icecream, a combination I highly recommend.\n
678	Spicy Cranberry Sauce with Pinot Noir	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cranberries and fresh ginger; stir until cranberries begin to burst, 3-5 minutes. \n\n2 Add wine and sugar; boil until mixture is reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes. \n\n3 Add crystallized ginger, curry powder and five-spice powder.  \n\nServe sauce cold or warm.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here is a delightful spin on a fall favorite – cranberry sauce. The cranberries are cooked in Pinot Noir and spiced with curry, ginger, fennel seeds, and other spices. Simply Recipes reader John Klem passed this Epicurious recipe on to me, which so sounded intriguing, we just had to try it. I reduced the sugar and the curry powder a bit and the cranberry sauce came out beautifully – sweet, but not too sweet, seeped in the flavor of a good Pinot Noir, and enlivened with a rich blend of spices. I highly recommend it if you would like to stretch a bit beyond the standard cranberry sauce.\n
680	Pumpkin Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).  Sift together the flour, salt, sugar, and baking soda.  \n\n2 Mix the pumpkin, oil, eggs, 1/4 cup of water, and spices together, then combine with the dry ingredients, but do not mix too thoroughly.  Stir in the nuts.  \n\n3 Pour into a well-buttered 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.  Bake 50-60 minutes until a thin skewer poked in the very center of the loaf comes out clean.  Turn out of the pan and let cool on a rack.\n\nCan easily double the recipe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Double the recipe and make two loaves of pumpkin bread.\nWhenever we carve up a pumpkin for Halloween I’m always reluctant to throw the pieces out. We salvage the pumpkin seeds and roast them for a tasty snack, but what to do with the pieces left over from carving out noses, eyes, and ghoulish smiles? Pumpkin bread is an easy way to use up leftover pumpkin, or any winter squash for that matter. The recipe calls for a cup of pumpkin purée which you can either get from a can, or make yourself by steaming or roasting the pumpkin pieces, scooping out the flesh, and either mashing with a fork or blending in a food processor.\n \nIf you use pumpkin purée from a can you might get a stronger pumpkin flavor than using Halloween pumpkin. Jack-o-lantern pumpkins are raised for their durability more than for their taste. But if you have a sugar pumpkin, butternut squash, or a Japanese kabocha pumpkin, those cook up deliciously. The spices make this quick bread quite tasty, and the squash helps the loaf stay deliciously moist. It’s a lot like a pumpkin version of banana bread. Yummy and easy to make.\n
747	Potato Gnocchi	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Spear the potatoes with fork tines in several places around each potato to vent moisture as the potatoes cook.  Bake the potatoes in their skins until tender, about an hour.  Let cool on a rack, cutting them open to help cool and let more moisture escape.\n\n\n\n2 Scoop out the potatos from their skins.  Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer and into a large bowl.  (If you don't have a potato rice you can mash the potatoes by hand and fluff them up a bit with a fork.)  It is best to work with the potatoes when they are still warm.\n\n\n\n3 Add the flour, egg and a pinch of salt.  Mix by hand until you have a nice pliable ball of dough.  Do not overmix.\n\n4 Prepare a work area and dust it with flour.  Take the dough, a piece at a time, and roll it out gently with your hands until you have rolls about 3/4 inch in diameter.  It is very important to keep a light touch while you are rolling the dough.  Gently roll the dough with your fingertips while while exerting the lightest pressure outwards, not down, to draw the dough out.\n\n5 Cut the tubes of dough into pieces about one inch long.  Using either the tines of a fork or your fingertip, press against a piece of the dough and roll it slightly to form an indentation (good for catching the sauce). As the gnocchi are made, place them on flat baking pan, lightly dusted with flour or lined with wax paper.  At this point you can freeze the gnocchi ahead of time.  Freeze them first on a floured or lined tray, then once frozen you can put them into a freezer bag for more easy storage.  To cook, just put the frozen gnocchi into the simmering water for the next step.\n\n\n\n6 Bring at least 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a shallow saucepan.  Gently drop the gnocchi, a few at a time, into the water.  As soon as they rise to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon, draining well.  Arrange on a warm serving dish.  Continue cooking the gnocchi in the same manner.\n\n7 As soon as all the gnocchi are ready, pour heated pasta sauce over them and sprinkle with the parsley.  Serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My parents took their first trip to Europe a couple years ago, spending a week in the Tuscany region of Italy. They both came back inspired by the Italian food they enjoyed and, as a result started to make many of the Italian dishes they had while in Italy. This is one of the dishes we started making as a result of their trip, and we’ve experimented with various ratios of potato to flour. What you want is a minimal amount of flour, too much and the gnocchi will be too dense. The trick, we’ve learned, is to use older potatoes, and to bake them, not boil or steam them, so that they get pretty dried out. Also it helps to put them through a potato ricer for a smoother consistency. Gnocchi goes well with practically any good pasta sauce. \n
681	Roasted Red Pepper Potato Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Roast the red bell peppers by placing them over or under an open flame until they blacken on all sides.  (You can use a grill, cooktop gas burner, or oven broiler.)  Place the blackened peppers in a bag, close the bag and let the peppers steam for 10-15 minutes, or until the skins feel like they can easily be slipped off.  Remove the peppers from the bag, peel off the blackened skins, remove the seeds.  Chop the peppers roughly.\n\n2 Heat the butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped onion and saute for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the potatoes and cook another 1-2 minutes, then add the garlic and roasted peppers.  Stir well and cook for 2 minutes. \n\n3 Add the stock, stir well and bring to a simmer.  Cook over medium heat until potatoes are soft. \n\n4 Purée the soup in a blender or food processor until very smooth.  Fill the blender about halfway with the soup.  Start the blender on low and keep your hand on the top, in case the lid wants to pop off from the rising steam.  Once everything is well chopped, turn the blender to its highest setting and blend until smooth, about 1 minute. You might need to do this in batches. \n\n5 Return to a clean pot set over low heat. Add the cream, stir well and taste. Add some cayenne, salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated Aug 31, 2010\nThe inspiration for this recipe comes from my mother’s friend Claire, who grows beautiful red bell peppers in her garden. She brought over some soup for us to try and a recipe. Over the years we’ve adjusted the recipe to include more peppers and fewer potatoes, to intensify the roasted red pepper flavor. By the way, this soup is open to flexibility on the ingredients and amounts. Claire originally made her soup with non-fat milk instead of the cream, and it was still wonderful.\n
682	Italian Sausages with Ratatouille	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Using a large oven-proof pan over medium-high heat, sauté onions in olive oil until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and reduce heat to low.\n\n2 While the onions and garlic are cooking over low heat, put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a another large skillet over high heat. As soon as the pan gets hot, add enough zucchini cubes to form a layer on the bottom of the pan.  Cook over high heat, stirring, until zucchini is lightly browned on all sides. Remove zucchini cubes, and add them to pan with the onions.\n\n3  Repeat process until all of the zucchini cubes have been cooked.  Continue with the bell peppers, then the eggplant cubes, adding the browned vegetables to the onion pan as soon as they are cooked.  Add more olive oil as needed.\n\n4 Add the tomatoes (and their juice) to your large oven-proof pan with the rest of the vegetables, along with salt, black pepper, red pepper, thyme, rosemary and 1/4 cup of water.  Bring to a boil.  Nestle the sausages in the pan.\n\n5 Transfer to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 30 to 40 minutes, until the sausages are cooked through.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father loves ratatouille and Italian sausage, so when he saw a recipe in a magazine that combined the two, he was inspired to create his own version. This is a great way to use up last-of-the-season garden vegetables. \n
683	Spicy Crab Cakes with Horseradish Mayo	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Tear up the bread and pulse in a food processor to make fine, soft crumbs (about 4 cups).  Transfer the bread crumbs to a shallow pan and mix in 1/2 cup of the parsley.\n\n2 In a food processor, combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, mustard, paprika, thyme, celery seeds, and black pepper.  Pulse to combine.  With the motor running, add the oil through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream until the mixture emulsifies and forms a mayonnaise-type sauce.  Transfer sauce to a bowl.\n\n3 In a large bowl, combine the onion and bell pepper with the remaining 1/4 cup of parsley.  Add the mayonnaise-type sauce  and crabmeat  and mix lightly.  Using a rubber spatula, fold in 1 cup of the bread crumb mixture.  Do not overwork the mixture.  Gently form 6 cakes and flatten them into patties about 1/2 inch thick.  Dredge the patties lightly in the remaining bread crumb mixture.  Cover the crab cakes with plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour or longer.\n\n4 Heat a large non-stick skillet on medium heat and add about 2 Tbsp of butter to the pan.  Working in batches, fry crab cakes gently 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and heated through.  Add more butter to the pan if necessary.\n\n5 To prepare the horseradish mayo, combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  Cover and refrigerate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The big food thrill of winter in Northern California is that it is Dungeness Crab season. There is simply nothing better than fresh cracked crab, but you have to make sure the crab is very fresh. During the season we will call Whole Foods and ask when the last shipment came in. If it is the same day, we’re there. Sometimes we greedily pick up more crab than we can actually eat in one sitting. In these cases, the crab meat gets formed into crab cakes to be eaten at the next meal. My father found this recipe for spicy crab cakes recently and they were are absolutely delicious.\n
766	Pineapple Tomato Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine all of the ingredients in a medium sized bowl.\n\nMakes approximately 3 cups.\n\n* Take care when handling hot chile peppers.  Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling them.  Avoid touching your eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A few weeks ago I got together with Garrett to roast some chile peppers and make some coconut pineapple cupcakes. We had loads of extra pineapple, and all the other ingredients for a great salsa, so naturally we put them all together, and voilá! A great combination. Use the tomato pineapple salsa with fish tacos, or over grilled steak or pork, or even wrapped up in a heated flour tortilla with a few slices of avocado.\n
684	Cranberry Relish	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Set up the grinder with a medium-sized blade on the edge of a table with a large roasting pan or bowl to catch the mix as it grinds.  These old fashioned grinders tend to leak some of the juice down the grinder base, so you may want to set up an additional pan on the floor under the grinder to catch the drips.  If you don't have an old-fashioned grinder you can use a grinder attachment on a KitchenAid mixer, you can chop by hand (though that will take a lot of work), or you can chop in a food processor (be very careful not to over-pulse, or you'll end up with mush).\n\n\n\n2  Run fruit through a grinder. Use the entire (seedless) orange, peels, pith and all.  \n\n3 Mix in the sugar. Let sit at room temperature until sugar dissolves, about 45 minutes.  Store in the refrigerator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This is a great cranberry relish for all turkey dishes and turkey sandwiches, and a tasty alternative to a more traditional cranberry sauce. The relish consists of raw cranberries, apples, and an orange, all put through a grinder with sugar added to macerate. The resulting relish is truly delicious. A few years ago I was served this relish at my uncle’s house; he had received some as a gift from a friend who is a professional chef in San Francisco. I begged my uncle to ask his friend for the recipe. He did, and here it is: \n
685	Sweet Potato Pie with Pecan Topping	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Make the pie crust.  (See pie crust recipe for instructions on pre-baking a pie crust.)  If you use a store-bought frozen crust, you do not need to pre-bake it, just defrost it 10 minutes and prick the bottom all over with a fork before using.\n\n2 Make the sweet potato purée.  In a large saucepan, cover the sweet potato pieces with water and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 15 minutes or until the sweet potato pieces are soft when poked with a knife or fork.  Drain.  Purée in a food processor until smooth.  You may need to add back a little liquid (a tablespoon or two of water) to get a smooth consistency.  Let cool completely before using.\n\n3 Prepare the pie.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Place rack at bottom of oven.  In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and maple syrup until smooth.  Add the sweet potato purée, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 3/4 cup of cream.  Mix until completely smooth.  Pour into cooled crust.\n\n4 Bake the pie.  Bake on lowest rack for 50 minutes, until filling has set.  You may want to tent the edges of the pie with aluminum foil or a pie crust protector to prevent the pie crust edges from burning.  Cool on rack for one hour.  Then transfer to refrigerator and chill completely.\n\n5 Make the pecan topping.  Melt 3 Tbsp butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar and cook, stirring, until smooth, about 3 minutes.  Add 1 Tbsp cream, and mix in.  Add the pecans, mix to coat the pecans with the sugar mixture.  Let cool for 1 minute.  Pour mixture over cooled pie.  Use a rubber spatula to spread topping over the top of the pie.  Cool until topping has hardened, about 30 minutes.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I’ve had so many friends rave about sweet potato pie that when I found a recipe for one in Martha Stewart’s Everyday Food magazine I just had to try it. Given that I completely botched the first pie crust (forgot to chill it before baking it -grrr) and many steps require chilling this or that for an hour, the whole production took a lot longer than I thought it would. Was it worth it? Yes! This is a delicious sweet potato pie and worthy of any Thanksgiving table.\n
686	Pomegranate Molasses	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn a large, uncovered saucepan, heat pomegranate juice, sugar, and lemon juice on medium high until the sugar has dissolved and the juice simmers. Reduce heat just enough to maintain a simmer. Simmer for about an hour, or until the juice has a syrupy consistency, and has reduced to 1 to 1 1/4 cups. Pour out into a jar. Let cool. Store chilled in the refrigerator.\nIf you want your pomegranate molasses to be sweeter, add more sugar to taste, while you are cooking it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Liquid rubies\nEver since Pom Wonderful started marketing the health benefits of pomegranate juice, and selling them in those cool pom shaped bottles, more and more recipes calling for pomegranate molasses have been popping up. Pomegranate molasses is a traditional ingredient in Middle Eastern cooking and can be used in a variety of dishes such as Fesenjan Persian chicken stew or eggplant lentil stew. You can also mix it with a little orange juice and club soda for a refreshing punch. Pomegranate molasses can be found at Middle Eastern markets, or you can easily make some yourself with some pomegranate juice, sugar, and lemon. (Find more pomegranate molasses recipes by searching food blogs.)\n
687	Hashed Brussels Sprouts with Lemon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Place lemon juice in a large bowl. Cut bottoms off sprouts, and discard. Halve sprouts lengthwise.  If you are really ambitions, carefully cut out and discard the firm core of each sprout half.  Thinly slice the sprouts.  As you work, transfer slices into bowl with lemon juice. When all sprouts are sliced toss them in juice and separate leaves. (Recipe can be prepared to this point and refrigerated, covered, for up to 3 hours.)\n\n2 When ready to serve, heat oil and butter over high heat in a skillet large enough to hold all sprouts. When very hot (almost to smoking point) add sprouts, garlic and seeds, and cook, stirring often, until sprouts are wilted and lightly cooked, but still green and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Some leaves might brown slightly.\n\n3 Add vermouth, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, 1 minute more. Turn off heat, add salt and pepper to taste and stir in the lemon zest, reserving a little for top of dish. Transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with remaining zest and serve.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	These got a little browned, but they were still crunchy and delicious.\nWhen I announced that I wanted to make brussels sprouts, inspired by a recent recipe in the New York Times, my father let out a loud groan. Dad, who loves rutabagas, parsnips, kale, collard greens, and all manner of cabbage, has never had an affinity to that particular vegetable. Probably because if you overcook them, brussels sprouts can be somewhat unpleasant. However, cooked well, they are nutty in flavor and delicious as a side dish. I adapted this recipe from the NYT to serve four, and added a little more butter to balance the acidity from the lemon juice. Dad heartily endorses this recipe (he finished his plate and even had seconds.)\n
688	Caramelized Nut Tart	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrust:\n\n1 Place flour, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a food processor, and pulse until mixed.  Add the pieces of butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Mix in vanilla and enough ice water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll dough out on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer dough to 9 1/2-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Fold overhang in and press, forming high-standing double-thick sides. Pierce dough all over with fork. Freeze 15 minutes.\n\n3 Bake crust until set but still pale in color, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool. Increase oven temperature to 400°F.\n\nFilling:\n\n\n\n4 Combine sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat. Boil without stirring until caramel is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. \n\n\nGradually whisk in cream (mixture will bubble). Stir until caramel is smooth. Add butter, honey and vanilla. Stir until well blended. Mix in all nuts.\n\n5 Pour caramel mixture into crust. Bake until entire filling bubbles, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on rack.\n\nServe with whipped cream (optional).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here is a delicious autumn nut tart that you can make with practically any mixture of nuts. Just make sure you get the freshest nuts possible – from your local farmers market, or from the bins at stores with high turnover like Whole Foods. We use nuts frozen from last year’s harvest. Nuts will get rancid, so definitely check for that before using. Freeze any nuts left over. The recipe is from Bon Appétit magazine, December 1998 issue. The Bon Appétit recipe calls for the drizzling of melted white chocolate on top of the tart for decorative effect. Just melt a ounce of white chocolate over a double boiler and use a fork to drizzle swirls on top of the tart. I don’t think this tart needs any more sweetness, so we skipped that step. But it is excellent with whipped cream. \n
689	Onion Potato Gratin	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreheat oven to 400°F (unless preparing in advance).\n\n1 Boil the potatoes for 4 minutes in salted water. Drain and set aside. \n\n2 Heat the butter over medium-high heat in a large sauté pan and cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle them with salt and the herbes de provence. Turn off the heat and set aside.\n\n3 Spread half of the sliced potatoes over the bottom of an 11x7-inch baking dish (Pyrex works well).  Sprinkle well with salt and white pepper.  Sprinkle with about a third of the Gruyure and Parmesan cheeses. Top with the onions, the nutmeg and another 1/3 of the cheeses. Layer the remaining sliced potatoes on top of the cheeses.  Pour the half and half over everything.  Sprinkle again with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle the remaining one-third of the cheeses over everything.  (At this point you can make a day ahead, just cover and refrigerate until time to cook.)\n\n4 Bake uncovered in 400°F oven until cream thickens and everything is nicely browned, about 25-30 minutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated March 3, 2011\nWith cheese, onions, and potatoes, how can one go wrong? Unless of course you are on a diet, in which case you should probably stay away from this one. This recipe is easy to make, delicious, and filling.\n
988	Homemade Tomato Juice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put all ingredients into a large non-reactive pot (use stainless steel, not aluminum).  Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until mixture is completely soupy, about 25 minutes.\n\n2  Force mixture through a sieve, chinoise, or food mill. Cool completely.\n\nStore covered and chilled.  Will last for about 1 week in the refrigerator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	For those of us who garden and grow tomatoes, there often comes a point in the summer tomato growing season in which the bounty greatly exceeds one’s ability to consume it, in its regular tomato form. If you find yourself in this position, and you love tomato juice, V8, Bloody or Virgin Marys, I highly recommend making your own tomato juice. My dad announced the other day that he was going to make some tomato juice and I thought nothing of it. But after one taste, wow. This is how V8 should taste.\n
690	Apple Cranberry Currant Crumble Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the brandy and the currants in a small bowl.  Let sit for at least an hour, until currants are plump.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat oven to 375°F.  In a large bowl mix 1 cup white sugar with 6 Tbsp flour, orange zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer currants from brandy (reserve the brandy) to the sugar mixture.  Add cranberries and apples and mix well.  Pour filling into unbaked pie pastry and drizzle with the reserved brandy.\n\n3 In another bowl mix 1 cup flour with 2/3 cup of brown sugar.  Add the butter and cut in with a pastry blender or rub with your fingers until the mixture forms small lumps.  Sprinkle topping over the filling.  Set pie in a foil-lined 10x15 inch baking pan (to catch the juices).\n\n4 Bake on bottom rack until juices bubble, 55 to 65 minutes.  If pie browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil.\n\n5 Set pie on rack, uncovered, to cool for 2 to 3 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	They say that as you get older you develop more of a sweet tooth. If my parents are any test of this theory, I would have to say, yes this does indeed seem to be true. When my siblings and I were kids (in the 60s) we had dessert once a month (not counting the coffee cake dad made on Sundays). These days nary a pie recipe gets published that my father doesn’t want to try, especially when I’m around to make the crust. He made this delicious crumble pie from one in Sunset Magazine a few days ago and it was half gone by noon. There are three of us. The pie serves 12. Did I say it was half gone by noon? You get the picture.\n
691	Toasted Turkey Cranberry Arugula Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToast 2 slices of bread.  Spread mustard on one slice, mayo on the other.  To the slice with mustard, add the turkey breast, then the cranberry sauce, then the arugula leaves.  Top with the other slice of bread.  Cut in half.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s turkey season and this week we experimented with several different ways to make a turkey cranberry sandwich – grilled, plain, toasted, with cream cheese, with gruyere, etc. – in our what-are-we-having-for-lunch test kitchen. The winner? Hands down favorite was simple sliced turkey breast with cranberry sauce and arugula, on toast with mayo and Dijon mustard.\nWhat’s your favorite turkey sandwich? (Let us know in the comments)\n
692	Mango Lassi	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPut mango, yogurt, milk, sugar and cardamom into a blender and blend for 2 minutes, then pour into individual glasses, and serve. Can sprinkle with a little cardamom.\n\nThe lassi can be kept refrigerated for up to 24 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mother received a huge mango the other day from a friend. Half of it went into some mango salsa; the other half into this rich mango lassi, essentially a smoothie made with mango and yogurt. I always order one when out to eat at an Indian restaurant. They’re really quite easy to make.\n
693	Polenta Sausage Mozzarella Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 3 Tbsp of olive oil in a large (2-3 qt) saucepan on medium heat. Add the sliced onion and sausage and sauté, stirring often, until the meat is browned. Add the garlic, salt, pepper, and fennel seeds to the sauté pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the tomato, cover the pan, lower the heat to medium, and simmer for 20 minutes.\n\n2 While the sauce is cooking, coat the bottom of a 9x13-inch lasagna or gratin pan (a pan that can handle the heat of a broiler) with a 1 Tbsp oil.  Add the cooked polenta (or slices) to the pan.  Coat the top of the polenta with a little more olive oil.  Broil the polenta about 4 inches from the heating element until golden brown and crispy, about 10-15 minutes.\n\n3 Pour sauce over broiled polenta, then arrange mozzarella slices over the top and return the casserole to the broiler.  Broil until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown, about 2 minutes.  Let cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father found this recipe in a recent Sunset Magazine and it sounded so good he just had to try it. He even made the polenta from scratch instead of using the store-bought prepared version which the original recipe called for. (How cool is that?) Polenta with an Italian sausage tomato sauce, topped with Mozzarella – of course it was great. You can substitute turkey sausage for the Italian sausage or even skip the sausage and use chopped zucchini instead for a vegetarian option. Here is our slightly-modified-from-the-original version.\n
694	How to Make Corn Tortillas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBefore you start\nYou'll need a special corn flour called masa harina for making the tortillas. Masa harina is corn flour that has been treated with calcium hydroxide or "lime" which makes it more nutritious by releasing the niacin in the corn, and easier to digest. Masa flour can be found at Mexican markets or online at Amazon.com. Look for masa harina that is only corn and lime (calcium hydroxide) for corn tortilla making.\nYou can make the tortillas completely by hand, by forming a thin pancake with the dough between your hands. But unless you are somewhat experienced in this method, you'll get more consistent results by using a tortilla press. These too are available in Mexican markets and come either in wood or cast iron. They are available online at Amazon.com. The wooden tortilla press pictured I purchased for about $16 at a local Mexican market in town. You can also roll out the masa with a rolling pin, between pieces of wax paper.\n\nMaking the Masa Dough\nTo make 16-18 tortillas, start with putting 2 cups of masa flour in a large bowl. (Hint: for added "lift" you can mix in 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda.) Add 1 1/2 to 2 cups of very warm water to the masa flour (according to the directions on the package, some brands may call for different amounts of water). Mix in and let sit for 5 minutes or so. Begin working the masa with your hands to make the dough. Work the dough for several minutes. Press the dough with your fingers and the palms of your hands as if you were kneading bread dough. If at any point through the tortilla making process the dough seems too dry or too wet, add a little more water or masa to the dough.\nTake a piece of the masa dough and shape it into a ball the size of a plum, or slightly large golf ball. Make about 16-18 balls from the dough.\n\nPressing the Tortillas\nTake two pieces of wax paper or plastic from a plastic bag and cut them to the shape of the surface of the tortilla press. Open the tortilla press and lay one piece of wax paper on the press. Place the masa ball in the center. Place another piece of wax paper over the masa ball. Gently close the press and press down, until the dough has spread to a diameter of 6 inches.\n\nCooking the Tortillas\nHeat a griddle or a large skillet on high heat. Working one at a time, hold a tortilla in your hand, carefully removing the wax paper on each side. Allow the tortilla to rest half on your hand, and half hanging down, and gently lay the tortilla down on to the skillet. Start working on pressing the next tortilla. Cook the tortilla on the hot pan for 30 seconds to a minute on each side. The tortilla should be lightly toasted and little air pockets forming.\nRemove the tortillas to a tortilla warmer lined with dish towel or paper towels, or wrap them in a dish towel to keep them warm. Serve immediately or refrigerate and reheat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Nothing beats homemade tortillas made from scratch. The packaged tortillas you get at big American markets don’t even come close to a good, freshly made corn tortilla. My dear friend Martha’s husband Arturo recently spent an afternoon with me, taking me around to the Mexican markets, helping me to buy masa and a good tortilla press, and showing me (and now you) how incredibly easy (and cheap) it is to make fresh homemade tortillas.\n
772	Homemade Mango Chutney	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine sugar and vinegar in a 6 quart pot; bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. \n\n\n\n2 Add remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, until syrupy and slightly thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir occasionally during cooking. \n\n3 Pour into clean, hot jars leaving 1/2-inch headspace; close jars. Process in a water bath 15 minutes.\n\nMakes 6 (1/2 pint) jars\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of our favorite ways to eat chicken is baked or roasted, served with Spanish rice and a bit of mango chutney. Here’s an easy, excellent recipe for homemade golden mango chutney that I found on the C & H website. Do you like mango chutney? What are your favorite foods to eat it with?\n
695	Reuben Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Butter one side of four slices of bread, and place the slices buttered-side down on a large piece of wax paper on a flat surface. Top each with a slice of Swiss cheese, and then divide half of the corned beef among them.\n\n2 Using paper towels, squeeze out excess moisture from the sauerkraut.  Divide the sauerkraut among the sandwiches, and top each with one tablespoon of Russian dressing. Add another layer of corned beef and a second slice of Swiss cheese to each sandwich. Top with the remaining bread slices; butter the side facing out.\n\n3 Preheat a griddle or frying pan to medium heat. Cook the sandwiches on one side until the bread is golden brown. Use a spatula to carefully flip the sandwiches over and finish cooking on the second side. Cut the sandwiches in half before serving.\n\nServe with a side of coleslaw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The Sacramento Bee recently published a recipe for a Reuben Sandwich which sounded so good we just had to make it. That day. Corned beef, dark rye bread, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, with Russian dressing – grilled. According to the Wikipedia our national love affair with Reuben sandwiches has been going on since the 1920s, though the origin is disputed. \n
696	Persimmon Pudding Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  In a large bowl, mix the persimmon pulp, eggs, butter, milk and vanilla.  \n\n2 In a separate bowl mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices.  \n\n3  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, a third at a time, fully incorporating after each addition.  Add the chopped nuts.  \n\n4 Bake in a square glass pan, buttered, at 400°F until done (about 50 minutes).\n\nTop with a dollop of whipped cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Hachiya persimmons can bake up into a delicious, moist cake that is almost a pudding. This recipe takes only a half cup of added sugar and uses the sweetness of the persimmon pulp. \n \nLeft: unripe Hachiya persimmons; Right: ripe Hachiya persimmons\nPersimmons are a fruit of fall, displaying their bright orange orbs right around the time a chill sets in and trees begin to lose their leaves. They come in two varieties – Fuyu and Hachiya – with very different properties. The Fuyu persimmons are short and squat, looking a little like tomatoes; they are meant to be peeled, sliced, and eaten like apples. Hachiya (those pictured are Hachiya) are larger than the Fuyu and somewhat acorn shaped. They need to ripen completely. \n\nWhen the Hachiya persimmon behaves like a seriously overripe tomato (completely soft to the touch all around) and its insides are a slurry, that’s when they can be opened, and the sweet pulp spooned out and eaten. One makes baked goods with the pulp from Hachiya persimmons. For convenience the pulp can be frozen in one or two cup batches.\n
697	Roasted Garlic Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the brine by combining garlic, water, salt, pepper and olive oil in a blender. Squeeze the juice from the lemon wedges into the brine, blend. Stir in the bay leaves.\n2 Place chicken in a large, resealable plastic bag, or in a large non-reactive bowl. Pour the brine all over the chicken in the bag, or in the bowl. Add the (already squeezed) lemon wedges. Squeeze out all the air from the bag and seal, or place plastic wrap over the chicken in the bowl. Refrigerate overnight - 12 to 24 hours.\n3 Preheat the oven to 375°F. Remove the chicken from the brine. Sprinkle salt and pepper all over the chicken. Place the chicken on a rack, in a roasting pan, breast side up. Roast for about an hour, until the juices run clear from the thigh when pierced with a fork. (Thigh meat should have an internal temperature of 160°F before removing from oven.)\nLet the chicken rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The trick to this tender, succulent roast chicken is the overnight brining. We usually roast chickens breast side down to ensure tender breast meat. But with the overnight brining in a roasted garlic and lemon juice marinade, the breast meat was perfectly moist, even cooked breast up. The garlic flavor is subtle, not strong or overwhelming, due to roasting the garlic first.\n
698	Stuffed Meatloaf with Spinach and Red Bell Pepper	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If you are using a fresh red bell pepper instead of an already prepared roasted red pepper, cook red bell pepper over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Wrap in paper bag and let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed and slice pepper into 1/2-inch-wide strips.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach and toss until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer spinach to small bowl. Add remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil to skillet, then onions and garlic; sauté until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to large bowl. Stir breadcrumbs, eggs, basil, ketchup, thyme, mustard, steak sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper into onion mixture. Mix in veal.\n\n3 Place half of veal mixture in 9 x 5 x 3-inch metal loaf pan. Using back of spoon, make 1-inch-wide, 1/2-inch-deep canal lengthwise down middle of loaf. Lay half of red bell pepper strips in canal. Layer with spinach and remaining bell peppers. Fill pan with remaining veal mixture, pressing firmly.\n\n4 Bake meat loaf until brown on top and thermometer inserted into center registers 160°F, about 50 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes. Cut into 8 slices and serve.\n\nServes 8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We love meat loaf in this house. My father found this recipe in an old issue of Bon Appetit and made it it the other day. It was really quite good, and pretty too (as pretty as meatloaf can be) with the stuffing of red bell peppers and green spinach.\n
699	Sausage Breakfast Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Heat a skillet on medium high.  Break up the sausage into chunks and cook, working in batches if need be, until browned all around.  Make sure the chunks of sausage have some space around them or your meat will steam and not brown.  Remove the cooked sausage from the pan and let sit on some paper towels on a plate to soak up the excess fat.  Crumble into smaller pieces. \n\n2  Place bread in a well buttered 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with cheese. Combine the eggs, milk, dry mustard, onion powder and pepper.  Pour evenly over the bread and cheese. Sprinkle sausage and optional ingredients over the top. \n3 At this stage you can cover and chill overnight, if you want to prepare ahead.  If not, let sit for 10 minutes before putting in the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Bake uncovered for about one hour. Tent with foil if top begins to brown too quickly.\nServes 6-8.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I think this recipe is based on one from a Jimmy Dean ad. I got it from my friend Heidi, and we’ve both made it several times for brunch gatherings. If you want you can make it ahead the night before and just put it in the oven for an hour right before you want to serve it. Eggs, Italian sausage, bread, milk, cheddar cheese – yum!\n
700	Cioppino	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Steam mollusks (clams and mussels) in a small amount of water (about two cups) until they just open. Set aside. Strain and reserve the cooking broth.\n2 Remove the crab legs from the body and use a nut cracker to crack the shells so that the meat can be easily removed once it is served (leave the meat in the shell). Break the body in half, and then cut each half again into either halves or thirds. You can opt to keep the crab meat in the body segments and serve it that way (more work for the eater) or you can pick out the crab meat from the body segments. If you pick out the crab meat, try to keep it in big chunks. Keep the top shell of the crab for making stock.\nNote you can use prepared fish or shellfish stock, or you can make your own. If you are not making your own stock, you can discard the crab top shell body. If prepared shellfish stock is not available, I would combine some prepared fish stock (available at many markets, including Trader Joe's) with clam juice.\n3 Split the shrimp shells down the back and remove the black vein. (See how to peel and devein shrimp.) I found the easiest way to do this, without removing the shell, is to lay the shrimp on its side and insert a small knife into the large end of the shrimp, with the blade pointing outward from the back (away from the shrimp and your hands). Once you have split the shrimp shells, you can turn the knife toward the shrimp, and cut in a little to find the black vein. Pull out the vein as much as you can. You can probably also use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the backs of the shrimp.\nAlternatively, you can shell the shrimps and devein them. Shell-on imparts more flavor; shell-off is easier to eat.\n4 In a deep 8-quart covered pot, sauté onions and bell pepper on medium heat in olive oil until soft. Add the garlic, sauté 1 minute more. Add tomatoes, broth from the mollusks, red wine, tomato juice, fish or shellfish stock, the herb bouquet, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove herb bouquet. Taste and correct seasoning.\n5 Add the fish and cook, covered, until the fish is just cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the steamed mollusks, crabmeat, and shrimp. Heat just until shrimp are cooked (just 2-3 minutes, until they are bright pink). Do not overcook.\n6 Serve in large bowls, shells included. Sprinkle with minced parsley. Serve with crusty French or Italian bread and a robust red wine. Have plenty of napkins available, a few extra bowls for the shells, and nut crackers and tiny forks for the crab.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“I’ll make cioppino,” my brother John announced as the family discussed what to make over the holiday weekend. “Great!” said my father and I, relieved that someone else would do the cooking for a night. “Have you ever made cioppino before?” Dad wisely asked. “Uh, no, but it can’t be that hard, just make a tomato base and throw in some fish, clams and crab.” Okay. Relief short lived.\n\nActually cioppino, a tasty fish and shellfish stew, is pretty easy to make if you have the ingredients. The trick is using the highest quality seafood. I wouldn’t attempt this stew unless I had access to very fresh fish and shellfish, fortunately abundant in the San Francisco Bay Area. Whole Foods usually carries good seafood, but you should always check when they got the item in. Preferably it came in that morning. Asian markets can be a good source of fresh seafood as well, often available at a much lower price than that of Whole Foods. If your fishmonger has some good fish or shellfish stock for sale as well, all the better.\nNote that cioppino is typically served with the shellfish still in their shells, making for somewhat messy eating. It’s a lot of fun for an informal gathering. Have plenty of napkins available and don’t wear white.\n\n
701	Prime Rib	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Remove roast from the refrigerator, loosely wrapped, 3 hours before cooking. Roasts should always be brought close to room temperature first, before they go in the oven.\nCookbooks often call for the excess fat to be removed. By "excess" fat they mean any fat more than an inch thick. The fat is what provides the flavor and what you are paying for with prime rib, so you want to leave it on. Your butcher should have removed any excess fat.\nIf your butcher hasn't already done so, cut the bones away from the roast and tie them back on to the roast with kitchen string. This will make it much easier to carve the roast, while still allowing you to stand the roast on the rib bones while cooking.\n2 Preheat your oven to 500°F, or the highest it will go (our oven only goes up to 450°F). Generously sprinkle salt and pepper all over the roast.\n3 Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure it doesn't touch a bone. (Some meat thermometers require that you poke a hole first with a skewer, and then insert the thermometer.) Place the roast, fat side up, rib side down in a roasting pan in the oven.\n4 After 15 minutes on 500°F, reduce the heat to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. The actual cooking time will depend on the shape of the roast and your particular oven. A flatter roast will cook more quickly than a thicker one. So make sure to use a meat thermometer. (I recommend this remote ChefAlarm thermometer.) This is not a roast to "wing it". Error on the rare side.\nRoast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium.\nCheck the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer a half hour before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 2 hours of total cooking time, or 1 hour 45 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°.\nOnce the roast has reached the desired internal temperature, remove it from oven and let rest 20 minutes, covered with aluminum foil, before carving. The roast will continue to cook while it is resting.\n \n5 With a knife or scissors, cut the strings which attach the meat to the bones. Remove the bones (save for making stock for soup. Then, using a sharp carving knife, slice meat across the grain for serving, making the slices about 1/4-1/2 inch thick.\nMaking gravy\nTo make the gravy, remove the roast from the pan. Place pan on stove on medium high heat. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings to a separate container. Into the 2 tablespoons of drippings in the pan stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour. Stir with a wire whisk until the flour has thickened and the gravy is smooth. Continue to cook slowly and stir constantly. Slowly add back the previously removed drippings (remove some of the fat beforehand if there is a lot of fat). In addition add either water, milk, stock, cream or beer to the gravy, enough to make 1 cup. Season the gravy with salt and pepper and herbs. (See also How to Make Gravy.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Prime rib refers to the king of beef cuts, the standing rib roast, “standing” because to cook it, you simply position the roast on its rib bones in the roasting pan, no need for a rack. Estimate 2 people served for every rib. Note that just because you are ordering a “prime” rib, it doesn’t mean that you are getting USDA Prime. Most “prime ribs” we get from market are actually USDA Choice quality.[1] If you want USDA Prime prime rib, which has more fat marbling throughout the meat, and which can easily cost 50% more per pound, you will likely need to special order it from your butcher.\n
702	Dad’s Favorite Fudge	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare everything in advance and have ready to go - chopped chocolate, chopped nuts, best to have marshmallow cream already out of the jar and in a bowl that you can easily scrape out with a rubber spatula.  Line a 13"x9"x2" baking pan with foil, butter the inside (alternatively, line the pan with waxed paper).\n\n2 In a 3-quart, thick-bottomed saucepan, bring sugar, butter, and milk to a rolling boil on medium heat, stirring constantly once the mixture begins to bubble.  Once the mixture reaches a boil, set your timer to 4 minutes.  You will want to remove the mixture from the heat once it reaches 234°F on a candy thermometer (234°F at sea-level, adjust for altitude) which should take about 4 minutes.  If you don't have a candy thermometer, just go with the four minutes.\n\n3 Remove from heat.  Quickly stir in chocolate and marshmallow cream.  Once those have melted and are well mixed, stir in the vanilla and then the walnuts.\n\n4 Pour into prepared pan. \n\n5 Cool to room temperature before slicing (about 4 hours).  You may want to chill in the refrigerator to get it more firm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Most of us have memories of special food we enjoyed at Christmas when we were little. The clearest memory for me is of my dad making fudge for all of us (six kids). The last time I recall him making his fudge was when we all still lived at home 25 some odd years ago. Turns out the recipe comes from the back of a 7 oz. jar of Kraft’s marshmallow cream. It is known as “fantasy fudge” and is just as good as I remember it. The recipe makes about 3 lbs of fudge, so I can see why he hasn’t made it in a while; that’s a lot of fudge! If I make this again I think I will double the amount of walnuts, and substitute almond extract for the vanilla just to see how it goes. Regarding the marshmallow cream, I think you could easily substitute 7 oz of plain marshmallows. \n
703	Sugar Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Sift dry ingredients, cut in butter and add other ingredients.  Blend thoroughly; chill for several hours.  \n\n2 Break off a piece of dough the size of an orange and pat it flat in your hand.  Using a rolling pin, roll on dough on floured board (best to use a 2/1 ration of flour/sugar - 4 Tbsp flour mixed with 2 Tbsp sugar) or between wax paper.  (It helps if you flour both sides of the dought.) Roll out to about a 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut out and put on silpat-lined or ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake 5-8 minutes at 400 F.  Remove the cookies from the oven as soon as you see them turning color at the base of the cookie.  Let cool completely. \n\n3 Mix icing ingredients together until smooth.  Separate into different bowls, add food coloring to achieve various colors.  Spread on cookies with a butter knife, use cake decorating piping equipment to add decorative accents. If you want the sprinkle type decorating candies to stick, brush the cookie with clear Karo syrup and then sprinkle.\n\nMakes 5 dozen cookies.\n\nUndecorated cookies\n\nThe icing begins\n\nUsing sprinkles\n\nThe finished product.\n\nAdapted from the recipe for Old Fashioned Sugar Cookies, Huntsville Heritage Cookbook,  1967, The Junior League of Huntsville, AL, Lowry Printing, Inc.\n\nSugar Cookie Recipe number 2\n\n\n\nCookie:\n\n1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners sugar\n1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature\n1 large egg\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n1/2 teaspoon almond extract\n2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon cream of tartarIcing:\n\n2 cups confectioners sugar, sifted\n1/2 teaspoon almond extract\n1/4 cup milk\nFood coloring1 Beat the butter and sugar together for 1 minute.  Add egg, vanilla and almond extract, beat until incorporated.  Combine dry ingredients and add to batter, stirring to blend.\n\n2 Divide dough in half, form 2 balls.  Wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.\n\n3 Using a rolling pin, roll out dough (about 1/2 of one dough ball at a time) on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8" thickness.  Dip cookie cutters into flour; cut out shapes.  Place cookies on silpat lined or lightly greased cookie sheets.  Bake at 375°F for 7-8 minutes.\n\n4 To make icing, combine sugar, almond extract and just enough milk (about 1/4 cup) to make the frosting the consistency of thin glue.  Pour icing into shallow bowls wide enough for dipping cookies.  Add food coloring.\n\n5 To decorate, dip the topside of each cookie into the icing.  Remove quickly and let icing drip of excess back into the icing bowl.  Let dry.  Pour additional colored frosting into pastry piping, or use a plastic sandwich bag with the tip of one corner nicked off.  Gently squeeze frosting on to cookies in whatever patterns you choose.\n\nMakes 2-3 dozen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Photos of this batch of cookies by SA Stephens\nWhen looking for good recipes for sugar cookies, I turned to my dear friend and Alabama native, Steve-Anna. She gave me two family favorites and we each picked a batch to make. Steve-Anna takes cookie decorating to a level unimaginable to me, so we are starting here with her cookie photos and cookies recipe. I chose a minimalist approach to decorating in the second recipe listed, as you will see. \n
704	Marinated Tri-Tip Roast with Mushrooms and Garlic	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the marinade by putting the marinade ingredients into a blender, and blend for 10 to 15 seconds until well blended. Place meat and marinade in a airtight plastic bag or plastic container.  Place in refrigerator and let marinate overnight.\n\n2 Remove meat from refrigerator and still wrapped, let come to room temperature.  \n\n3 Pre-heat oven to 500°F.  Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Rub olive oil all over the roast surface.  Place on a roasting pan, fat side up.   Bake in oven for 20-40 minutes (depending on the size of the roast) until the internal temperature is 130-135°F for rare, 140-145°F for medium.  If you have a smaller roast (1 1/2 lb), take it out on the low side of the range of temps.  Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 2-5 minutes (but no more than 5 minutes) before carving.  \n\n\n\n4 While the roast is cooking, you can prepare the mushrooms.  Coat the bottom of a large skillet with about 4 tablespoons of olive oil and bring to high heat.  Add the mushrooms, onions, garlic and sauté for several minutes, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms get browned and the onions translucent.  Add a cup of wine.  Reduce the wine, adding more wine as needed if the mushrooms absorb too much.\n\n5  Slice the roast against the grain and serve slices with the mushrooms.\n\nServes 4-8, depending on the size of the roast and your appetites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tri tip is a popular cut of meat here in California, often cut into steaks, or grilled whole. This flavorful cut comes from the bottom sirloin and is fairly lean. My friend Arturo, a local caterer specializing in Mexican cuisine, prepared this for me and other friends recently. It was so delicioso I begged him for the recipe, which is as follows.\n
705	Pickled Beets	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Remove greens from beets, save for future use (see beet greens recipe).  Cut beets to uniform sizes so they will cook evenly.  Steam or boil around 30 minutes or until done. (Alternatively, you can roast them by wrapping them whole in foil and cooking them in a 350°F oven for about an hour.)   A fork easily inserted into the beet will tell you if the beets are done or not.  \n\n2 Drain the beets, rinsing them in cold water.  Use your fingers to slip the peels off of the beets.  The peels should come off easily.  Discard the peels.  Slice the beets.\n\n3 Make the vinaigrette by combining the cider vinegar, sugar, olive oil, and dry mustard.  Whisk ingredients together with a fork.  The dry mustard will help to emulsify the vinaigrette.  Adjust to taste.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Combine beets and vinaigrette in a bowl and allow to marinate for a half hour at room temperature.\n\nServes four.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Most pickled beets I find are much too vinegary, hiding rather than enhancing the naturally sweet flavor of the beets. I usually just boil beets and eat them unadorned, but my mother has a way of preparing pickled beets that is truly delicious, complementing the sweetness without overpowering it.\n
706	Peppermint Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpecial equipment needed\nAn ice cream maker or a KitchenAid mixer with an ice cream attachment\n1 Warm the milk, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan. Make sure the sugar and salt completely dissolve.\n\n2 Pour the cream into a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and set a medium-mesh sieve on top.\n\n3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.\n\n4 Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden or heatproof rubber spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula, about 5-7 minutes.\n\n5 Pour the custard through the strainer and stir it into the cream. Then stir until cool over the ice bath. Chill mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator.\n6 One the mixture is thoroughly chilled, add peppermint extract, a 1/4 teaspoon at a time, tasting the mixture after each addition, until you reach the desired level of peppermintiness. (Different peppermint extracts vary in strength. I used 2 teaspoons of McCormick peppermint extract, which was just the right amount for our taste.)\n7 Once chilled, freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n8 Once the ice cream has been formed in the ice cream maker, it will be fairly soft. Fold in the crushed peppermint candy. Put in an airtight plastic container and place in the freezer for at least an hour, preferably several hours. If it has been frozen for more than a day, you may need to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften it before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I love peppermint ice cream! Too bad around here the grocery stores only stock it during the holiday season. This week I decided to make my own and got some great advice from the king of desserts himself, David Lebovitz on just how to go about it. David is coming out with a book on ice cream this spring (keep your eye out for it) so he should know. I fudged a bit with the ingredient proportions that David gave me, but the method is all his. Thank you David.\n\nAs with French vanilla ice cream this method requires cooking a custard to add to the cream. It’s a little more work, but the egg yolks are what makes the homemade ice cream divinely creamy. Otherwise, without all the emulsifiers that typically go into the store bought versions, homemade ice cream can be a bit icy. If I’m going to go to the trouble to make something from scratch, I want it to taste better than what I can buy from a store, and this does.\n
707	Osso Buco	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 325°F.    \n\n2 Heat a dutch oven on the stove top over medium heat for about five minutes.  Add pancetta to pan, cook, stirring occasionally. When the pancetta is crispy and most of the fat has rendered (about 5 minutes of cooking), remove the pancetta to a plate covered with some paper towel and set aside.  If necessary, drain off all but two tablespoons of the fat from the pan. \n\n3 Season the veal shank well with salt and pepper.  Dredge the veal shanks through some flour, shake off any excess, and add the meat to the hot fat in the pan.  Increase the heat to medium high and cook the meat on each side until well browned (about 5 minutes per side). Remove the shanks to a plate, set aside.\n\n4 Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the dutch oven. Cook the onion mixture, stirring frequently, until the onions are  translucent (about five minutes) and toss in the garlic and thyme. Continue cooking until the vegetables just begin to brown (about 10 minutes).\n\n5 Add the shanks and the pancetta back to the pan. Pour in the wine, and then add enough stock to come a little more than half way up the side of the shanks.  Bring to a simmer.  Cover the pan and put it in the oven to cook until the meat is tender, about an hour to an hour and a half. \n\n6 Combine the gremolata ingredients, place in a separate small serving dish.\n\nServe on top of risotto or polenta.  Sprinkle with gremolata.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I’ve made osso buco, an Italian dish of braised veal shanks, several times. I’ve eaten it in fine Italian restaurants. I’ve never really liked it until now. This is a great recipe that dad pulled from the web a few years ago which uses pancetta, instead of olive oil, for the browning of the veal and cooking the vegetables. Olive oil is the traditional method, so if you want to skip the pancetta, just substitute several tablespoons of olive oil. But the pancetta adds a lovely flavor dimension, and is probably the secret ingredient that has me liking osso buco for the first time. So use it if you can. “Osso Buco” means “hole of bone” because this marrow provides the rich flavor to the sauce. A marrow spoon, one of those long skinny spoons found in old sterling silverware sets, would come in handy with this dish, as the succulent shank marrow can be tricky to extract (I used the skinny end of a teaspoon). The gremolata (parsley, lemon zest and garlic) is an important garnish for this dish, don’t skip.\n
708	Le Talleyrand	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Drain the cherries and reserve the juice. Put the cherries into a bowl with 1/3 cup of kirsch or rum and 3/4 cup of the juice from one of the cans of cherries, and let sit for at least half an hour, stirring once or twice.\n2 Put the egg yolks and sugar into the top of a double boiler. (Save the neatest empty eggshell, trimming its edges with scissors.) Beat until fluffy and pale yellow, 2 or 3 minutes. Strain in the maceration liquid from the cherries, combining gently with a whisk. Stir in the ground almonds and flour. Set over low heat and stir constantly until the mixture forms a thick, smooth custard, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl set in an ice bath. Stir with a spatula until cold.\n3 Whip the cream until the beaters leave light traces on the surface. Beat in 2 tablespoons of the confectioners’ sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla, until soft mounds form. Set aside.\n4 Finishing the custard and the meringue.\na. Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff but not dry.\nb. Fold half of the egg whites into the cream until mixed.\nc. Stir 3 tablespoons of the cream and egg whites into the custard to lighten it; then fold all the custard back into the remaining cream mixture. Set aside.\nd. Add the remaining 8 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla to the remaining egg whites, and beat until glossy and the egg whites are stiff enough to hold their form when mounded on top of the custard (this may take several minutes).\n5 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-by-12-inch oval baking dish. Spread the cherries on the bottom and pour the custard over them. Spread the meringue over the custard, leaving a small border and making a dome of meringue toward the center. Press the eggshell into the meringue so that it shows only as a well in the center. (The dessert can be made up to 1 hour in advance to this point; keep refrigerated.)\n\n6 Sprinkle the meringue with the slivered almonds, then sift a little confectioners’ sugar over the top. Cook until the meringue is lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Heat the remaining kirsch or rum in a small saucepan. Remove the dish from the oven, pour some of the alcohol into the eggshell, letting the rest run over the meringue, and set aflame. Bring flaming to the table, spooning the liqueur over the top to caramelize the sugar, until the flames go out.\nServes 8.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I apologize in advance. This recipe is anything but simple. My father, the same dad who has never met a dessert recipe he didn’t want to try, discovered it recently in the New York Times. When we recalled that my brother Eddie’s birthday was coming up, any resistance there may have been to attempting this dessert was dashed. Never mind that on the day of, Ed couldn’t make it for dinner. The die was cast, Le Talleyrand was to be made, birthday boy or no birthday boy.\nLe Talleyrand is a dessert consisting of a layer of cherries soaked in kirsch, covered by a layer of custard, a layer of meringue, and then flambéed upon serving. The recipe comes from Simone Beck, also known as Simca, Julia Child’s collaborator on Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and author of Simca’s Cuisine. Christine Muhlke of the New York Times describes Simca as ” a woman so high-strung and exacting that she’s indexed in Child’s book with such minutiae as ‘hand injury of,’ ‘Julia’s contretemps with’ and ‘personality and temperament of’? Child called her ‘La Super-Française’; Paul Child called her ‘Sigh-Moan.’ No matter how refined her palate, her haughty, untelegenic French demeanor never won over the American public, and she quietly retired to her kitchens in Paris and Provence.” Of Le Talleyrand Ms. Muhlke wrote, “a fluffy, flambéed dessert that may mark the end of the era when dishes were named after the great men of history, or their mistresses.”\nLe Talleyrand was delicious, a little complicated to make but doable, and the flambé part really cool. Especially when spooning the blue-flamed burning kirsch from the egg shell over the rest of the meringue. We probably didn’t put the egg shell in deep enough, our dessert looks a little more like a volcano than it probably should, but the ooh ahh factor was still there. Enjoy.\n
709	Carnitas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, combine pork, broth, and salsa.  Add enough water to completely cover the meat.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered for 3 to 4 hours (or longer) until meat pulls apart easily.  Add salt to taste if needed.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Remove meat from liquid in pot (discard the liquid) and spread the meat out in a roasting pan.  Break the meat into small chunks.  Roast meat for 15 to 20 minutes until brown and crispy.\n\n3 If you are using store-bought tortillas, heat the tortillas one-by-one either in a microwave or on a hot skillet.  If you heat them on a skillet you may need to use a little butter or oil to help soften them.  When air pockets form in the tortillas they are ready.  To heat them in a microwave, place a paper towel on the floor of the microwave.  Lay one or two tortillas on the paper towel (whatever will fit so there is only one layer).  Microwave on high heat for 10 seconds per tortilla (some brands of tortillas require 20 seconds each).  Keep warm tortillas wrapped in a clean cloth towel for serving.\n\nTo serve, double up the tortillas and place a few spoonfuls of the carnitas on them.  Top with salsa.  Serve with grated lettuce (that has been lightly salted and sprinkled with vinegar), beans, avocados, and/or grated cheese.\n\nTo eat, remove half of the carnitas from one tortilla to another.  Take one tortilla at a time with the carnitas and salsa, fold it over and enjoy.  Or, keep them doubled up.  Your choice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Enter any Mexican taqueria in California and you’ll find carnitas on the menu, usually pork butt (the shoulder roast) braised first, pulled apart, and then roasted on high heat to caramelize. This is my father’s favorite recipe for pork carnitas which we put into fresh tortillas for tacos, with fresh tomato salsa. I think I could eat this everyday for a week and not get tired of it.\n
710	Wild Rice Cranberry Pecan Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Use the amount of water for the rice according to instructions on the rice package.  Typically straight brown rice is a 1:2 ratio of rice to water.  Straight wild rice is a ratio of 1:3 of wild rice to water.  For this brown rice wild rice mix that I got from a bin (no package) I used a ratio of 1 cup of rice to 2 1/3 cups of water.  Bring rice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, butter, and water to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 50 minutes.  Do not stir.  Do not uncover.  Remove from stove and let sit, covered for 10 minutes.  Then uncover, fluff up with a fork, and let cool to almost room temperature.\n\n2 In a medium sized serving bowl, mix the rice, cranberries, pecans, and green onions together.\n\n3 In a separate jar, mix the lemon juice, olive oil, orange peel, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste.  Just before serving, mix dressing in with the rice mixture.  Serve warm, chilled, or room temperature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This rice salad is a perfect accompaniment to many fall and winter dishes – roast chicken, stews, pork chops. You can use brown rice, wild rice (not really a rice at all), or a combination of the two. Both wild rice and brown rice have a rich, nutty flavor that complements the cranberries and pecans, and the citrus in the dressing.\n
711	Eggplant Lentil Stew with Pomegranate Molasses	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Partially peel the eggplant so it has lengthwise stripes, then cut it lengthwise into 4 slices. Score each slice on 1 side in a crosshatch pattern. Cut each slice crosswise into 3 pieces and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt. Let stand for 1 hour.\n2 In a small saucepan, cover the lentils with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the lentils.\n3 Coat a small (3-quart) enameled cast-iron casserole with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. In a bowl, toss the onion with the garlic, tomatoes, green chiles, mint, tomato paste, crushed red pepper and 2 teaspoons of salt.\n4 Rinse the eggplant and pat dry. Spread 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture in the casserole and top with half of the eggplant. Cover with half of the lentils and half of the remaining vegetable mixture. Top with the remaining eggplant, lentils and vegetables. Pour the remaining olive oil around the side and over the vegetables, then drizzle with the pomegranate molasses.\n5 Bring the stew to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat until the eggplant is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A few weeks ago I was wondering what to do with the end-of-season eggplants, tomatoes, and chiles from our garden and stumbled across this recipe from Food and Wine, which also calls for pomegranate molasses. The recipe comes from the coastal town of Antakya, Turkey. The ingredients are layered and not stirred, so the flavors of the different ingredients stay distinct. The stew is best when made ahead and allowed to mellow for a few hours before serving. I thought it needed just a touch of honey, which I will probably add next time.\n
712	Chicken Marinara	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and shallots and sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, oregano, and crushed red pepper. Simmer until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Mix in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.\n\n2 Blend breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese in small bowl. Place flour and eggs in separate shallow bowls. Coat chicken with flour, then eggs, then breadcrumb mixture.\n\n3 Preheat oven to 350°.  Heat remaining  oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, add chicken and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Place chicken pieces on an oven-proof serving dish.  Spoon sauce over chicken pieces.  Sprinkle with Mozzarella cheese.  Bake for 10 minutes, or microwave on high heat for 10-20 seconds, just until the cheese has melted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Chicken pieces coated with Parmesan and bread crumbs, fried and covered with a tomato basil marinara sauce, and topped with melted Mozzarella. My mother made this chicken marinara for dinner tonight and it was fabulous. She uses chicken thighs because they are more flavorful, but you could easily use breasts.\n
713	Beef Stroganoff	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Melt 3 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet on medium heat. Increase the heat to high/med-high and add the strips of beef. You want to cook the beef quickly, browning on each side, so the temp needs to be high enough to brown the beef, but not so high as to burn the butter. You may need to work in batches. While cooking the beef, sprinkle with some salt and pepper. When both sides are browned, remove the beef to a bowl and set aside.\n2 In the same pan, reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots. Cook the shallots for a minute or two, allowing them to soak up any meat drippings. Remove the shallots to the same bowl as the meat and set aside.\n\n3 In the same pan, melt another 3 Tbsp of butter. Increase heat to medium high and add the mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally for about 4 minutes. While cooking, sprinkle the nutmeg and the tarragon on the mushrooms.\n4 Reduce the heat to low and add the sour cream to the mushrooms. You may want to add a tablespoon or two of water to thin the sauce (or not). Mix in the sour cream thoroughly. Do not let it come to a simmer or boil or the sour cream will curdle. Stir in the beef and shallots. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nServe immediately over egg noodles, fettucine, potatoes, or rice. (Potatoes, rice, and gluten-free pasta are gluten-free options.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	According to the Wikipedia, Beef Stroganoff was invented by a chef working for a Russian general, Count Pavel Stroganov, in the 1890s. It became popular in the U.S. in the 1950s from servicemen returning from Europe and China after WWII. Beef Stroganoff is basically tender strips of beef and mushrooms cooked in a sour cream sauce and served over noodles, rice, or even French fries. You will want to make this with a tender cut of beef, such as tenderloin or top sirloin. For a quick version you can use ground beef instead of beef strips. You can also easily substitute yogurt for sour cream and leave out the mushrooms entirely.\n
714	Crab Salad with Pear and Hazelnuts	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a medium sized bowl mix the hazelnuts, celery, pear, onion, parsley, lemon juice, olive oil, ground pepper, and salt. Gently fold in the lump crab meat, trying not to break up the crab too much.\nMake individual servings, about a half cup each over a piece of butter lettuce.\nServes 4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Most crab lovers know that fresh crab pairs well with avocado. But have you ever tried it with roasted hazelnuts (also called Filberts)? I got this idea from a crab hazelnut pear appetizer prepared by Oregon chef Jason Stoller Smith. It’s lovely.\n
715	George’s Light Rye Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the molasses.  Put yeast mixture into a large metal bowl.\n\n2 Add caraway seeds, salt, vegetable oil, cocoa powder,  2 cups of rye flour and then 2 cups of baking flour, mixing into the yeast mixture after each addition with a wooden spoon.\n\n\n\n3 Add more bread flour, a cup at a time, until the dough is not so sticky and it is too hard to mix it with the wooden spoon.   At that point, spread a half cupful of flour onto a large, clean, flat surface and put the dough onto the surface.\n\n4 Knead the dough by pressing down with the heel of your hand, stretching it, turning the dough a quarter-turn, pulling the dough back toward you and then pressing and stretching again.  Knead additional bread flour into the dough until it reaches the right consistency.  Knead for 5-7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.\n\n\n\n5 Spread some vegetable oil around a large bowl and place the dough in it, turning it so it gets coated in the oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth.  Let rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, about an hour and a half.\n\n\n\n6 Gently press down on the dough so some of its air is released.\n\n\n\n7 Knead the dough a few turns and then divide it by cutting it in half with a sharp knife.\n\n\n\n8 Shape each half into loaf.  Place dough loafs into either oiled bread loaf pans, or onto a flat baking sheet or peel that has been sprinkled with corn meal, depending if you want to cook the loaves in pans or directly on a baking stone.  Cover with plastic or a damp cloth.\n\n9 Let rise again, this time not doubling in volume, but rising by about half of its volume, about 45 minutes, half as long as the first rising. The dough should be peeking over the top of the loaf pan if using a loaf pan.\n\n10 If you are using a baking stone, place the stone in the oven.  Preheat oven to 350°F for at least half an hour before baking.\n\n\n\n11 If baking on a stone, score the dough a few times on the top of the dough right before putting it in the oven.  Put dough in the oven.  If you have a mister, mist the dough with a little water the first 10 minutes of baking.  Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until done.  The bread should sound hollow when tapped.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	As long as I’ve known my friend George he has been an enthusiastic bread maker. George lives in Carlisle, Mass, and when I go out there to visit his daughter and grandchildren George often has a freshly baked loaf of rye bread for us to enjoy. This month George came to visit my family in Carmichael and naturally, I put him to work, showing me the way he makes his rye bread. The following is a recipe that will yield two loaves. Actually, I don’t think one can easily learn to make bread by reading about it. You have to get your hands in it and learn directly from someone who can say, “See? This is the right consistency for the dough.” If you are interested in learning more about bread making there are a few links at the end of this post that you may find useful. \nAs for the bread? It was wonderful. Light, soft inside, and a crusty crust. Dad doesn’t like caraway seeds so they were kept out. I love them so the next time I make this bread they’re going in. \n
716	Meyer Lemon Sorbet	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a small saucepan on medium high heat, make a simple syrup by heating sugar and water until the sugar has completely dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool. Mix in the lemon juice and zest. Chill, either in the refrigerator, or by placing in a metal bowl over an ice bath.\n2 Once the mixture has thoroughly chilled, freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can pour the mixture into a shallow pan and freeze in your freezer until semi-solid. Then take a fork and fluff it up, returning it the the freezer to freeze firm. Then put in a food-processor or blender to process until smooth.\nPlace sorbet in an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.\n3 Scoop out preferably with a melon-baller. Garnish with mint. Makes 2 1/2 cups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Making lemon sorbet is like making lemonade with a detour through the ice cream maker. Easy. We pulled down several Meyer lemons last week to avoid the freeze that hit here in California and I’ve been thinking up things to do with them. As a major lemonade fan, lemon sorbet was a logical choice. Lemon sorbet is pretty intense – sweet and acidic. I can see why it is often used as a palate cleanser between meal courses. It is best eaten in small amounts. An added benefit of having some around in the freezer is that if you happen to be in the mood for lemonade, you can take a few scoops and mix it in with some water, and voilà, instant lemonade.\n
717	Puréed Roasted Parsnips	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Peel parsnips, make a cut off the top of the fat end of each parsnip. This will show you extent of the inner core. Often this core is stringy and woody, especially at the larger end of the parsnip. When you are prepping the parsnips, cut around this core.\n\n2 Place chopped parsnips in a medium sized bowl, add the melted butter and stir to coat. Lay out the parsnips on a roasting pan in a single layer. Roast in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, at 400°F, until lightly golden, turning the parsnips once half-way through the cooking.\n3 Put cooked parsnips into a blender or food processor. Add 1 1/2 cups water, and pulse until puréed to the desired consistency. Add more water if necessary. Add nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The easiest way to prepare parsnips is to slice them, steam them, and dress with butter and salt. However, to get the fullest, richest flavor from the parsnips, they should be roasted. The browning caramelizes the natural sugars in the parsnips. In this recipe we first roast the parsnips with some butter, then purée them with added water. It’s quite simple, but if you’ve never had parsnips this way, you’re in for a treat.\n
718	Roasted Chicken with Carrots	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Preheat oven to 425°F. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper. Stuff with lemon, thyme and half of the garlic, then, using butcher's string, secure the wings and legs to the body.2 Place chicken in a small roasting pan or large, deep, oven-proof heavy skillet. Surround with the carrots and remaining garlic, then add 1 cup of the chicken stock. Drizzle with olive oil.3 Roast the chicken for 15minutes at 425°F.  If you have a convection oven, you can reduce the heat to 375°F for the remaining time (otherwise, just keep it at 425°F).  Roast until chicken is golden and carrots are well caramelized, 1¼ to 1½ hours; baste,  with broth and pan juices every 15 minutes for the first 45 minutes. Add stock if pan looks dry. 4 Transfer chicken, carrots and garlic to a platter. Discard twine, thyme and lemon, and let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Skim fat from pan juices and discard. Add vinegar to remaining pan juices and serve over the chicken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mother found this recipe in the weekend Wall St. Journal and we were all quite pleased with the results. The recipe comes from Orange County restauranteur Liza Goodell. Mom cooked the chicken in a large cast-iron frying pan, and as instructed basted every 15 minutes. Because the chicken’s back is resting in the broth a bit, it actually gets braised, while the rest of the chicken roasts. The chicken doesn’t dry out because of the extra broth in the pan and the frequent basting. This is an easy method for roasting a flavorful chicken.\n
719	Butter Pecan Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium sized heat-safe bowl (metal, ceramic, or glass), whisk together the egg yolks until well blended.  Set aside.\n\n2 Pour the cream into a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and set a medium-mesh sieve on top.  Set aside.\n\n\n\n3 In a medium thick-bottomed saucepan on medium heat, melt the butter cook it, stirring constantly, until it just begins to brown.  Add the brown sugar and salt.  Stir until the sugar completely melts.\n\n4 Slowly add the milk, stirring to incorporate.  It will foam up initially, so make sure you are using a pan with high enough sides.  Heat until all of the sugar is completely dissolved.  Do not let boil or the mixture may curdle.\n\n5 Whisk in hand, slowly pour half of the milk and sugar mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly to incorporate.  Then add the warmed egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk sugar mixture.\n\n6 Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden or heatproof rubber spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula, about 5-7 minutes.\n\n7 Pour the custard through the sieve and stir it into the cream. Add vanilla and stir until cool over the ice bath. Chill mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator.\n\n8 While the mixture is chilling, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Lay out the pecans on a roasting pan in a single layer.  Bake for 6 minutes, until lightly toasted.  Let cool.  Once cool, roughly chop the pecans and set aside.  Note, if you want an extra punch to this ice cream, brush the pecans with melted butter and sprinkle with salt before roasting.\n\n9 Once the ice cream mixture is thoroughly chilled, freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n\n10 Once the ice cream has been formed in the ice cream maker, it will be fairly soft. Fold in the chopped pecans. Put in an airtight plastic container and place in the freezer for at least an hour, preferably several hours. If it has been frozen for more than a day, you may need to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften it before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	An ice cream loving friend was in town this weekend, giving me the perfect excuse to make this batch of butter pecan ice cream. Butter pecan is one of my all time favorite flavors. In this recipe the butter flavor comes in the custard base, achieved by browning the butter first before adding the other ingredients. \n
720	Stuffed Pork Chops with Kielbasa and Sauerkraut	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Make the stuffing.  In a heavy skillet cook the onion, the garlic, and the sage in the butter over  low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the bread crumbs and salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.\n\n2 With a paring knife, make a 3/4-inch long horizontal incision along the fat side of each chop and cut a deep wide pocket in the chop by moving the knife back and forth carefully through the incision.  Fill the chops with the stuffing.  Pat the chops dry.\n\n3 In a large dutch oven, heat the oil over medium high heat.  Brown the chops on both sides, removing the chops from the pan to a plate when done.\n\n4 Add the kielbasa slices to the pan, browning them slightly on both sides, removing to another plate when done.\n\n5 Pour off all but 1 Tbsp of fat.  In the remaining fat cook the onion over medium heat, until softened.  Add half of the sauerkraut, spreading it to form a layer on the bottom on the pan.  Cover the sauerkraut with the pork chops.  Sprinkle on salt and pepper.  Add the kielbasa.  Spread the remaining sauerkraut over the chops and kielbasa.  Add the wine, broth and bay leaf.  \n\n6 Bring the liquid to a simmer and simmer the mixture, covered for 1 1/2 hours, or until the chops are tender.  Discard the bay leaf.  Transfer the chops and the kielbasa to a plate; cover with foil and keep warm.\n\n7 Add the sage to the sauerkraut mixture, bring mixture to a simmer.  Add the cornstarch mixture to the sauerkraut.  Stir, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Spoon sauerkraut on to a large serving plate.  Place the chops and kielbasa on top of the sauerkraut, sprinkle with fresh parsley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father is of German Austrian descent, so naturally we eat a lot of pork chops and sauerkraut. Recipes containing the same have almost a genetic pull over him. Add some kielbasa and the urge to try the recipe becomes irresistable. Dad found this recipe (made minor adjustments) in an old (1988) issue of Gourmet. Warm and hearty, it’s perfect for Winter.\n
721	Wilted Watercress Salad with Bacon Dressing	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse thoroughly the watercress, removing old leaves and thick stems. Set aside in a serving bowl.\n2 Heat a small stick-free pan on medium heat and cook the bacon until done, several minutes on each side. Remove the bacon from the pan and put on a paper towel. Keep the bacon fat in the pan.\n3 Add the cider vinegar and sugar to the bacon fat. Stir to dissolve. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, add a pinch of ground mustard and a pinch of paprika. Taste and adjust seasoning. This is a sweet-sour dressing, so if it is too acidic, add a bit more sugar, if too sweet, add a bit more vinegar.\n4 Bring the dressing to a simmer. Pour over the watercress. Crumble the bacon over the top. Toss and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Old fashioned watercress is getting harder to come by, at least around here in Sacramento. Whole Foods carries watercress, but the leaves are too tender, and lack the bite of what I grew up eating. This is my mother’s recipe for a wilted watercress salad with a warm, sweet and sour bacon dressing. It requires the sturdy watercress variety which can hold up to both the heat and the flavor of the dressing. I love this salad. It’s like a wilted spinach salad, only less wilted, and more peppery. In my father’s and my opinion, it really must be made with bacon fat and crumbled bacon. You can substitute olive oil, but it’s really not the same.\n\n
722	Three-Bean Baked Beans	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Cook bacon in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium heat until crisp. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels to drain. Crumble bacon and reserve.\n2 Add onion to drippings in pot and sauté until almost tender, about 5 minutes.\n3 Add dry mustard and thyme and stir 1 minute. Mix in ketchup, vinegar, molasses, 1/3 cup water, bay leaf and all beans. Season with salt and pepper.\n4 Cover pot and bake bean mixture 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water if mixture seems dry. Mix bacon into beans. Bake 15 minutes longer. Discard bay leaf. Mix in hot pepper sauce and serve.\nServes 4 to 6.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Baked beans are just the thing for a blustery day. My father pulled this recipe out of Bon Appétit magazine years ago and we’ve been enjoying its tangy, rich flavor ever since. A great side dish to pork or steak.\n
723	Homemade Pizza	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaking the Pizza Dough\n\n1  In the large bowl of a heavy duty electric mixer (such as a Kitchen Aid), add the warm water.  Sprinkle on the yeast and let sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.  Stir to dissolve completely if needed at the end of 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n2 Attach a mixing paddle to the mixer.  Mix in the olive oil, flour, salt and sugar on low speed for about a minute.  Remove the mixing paddle and replace with a dough hook.  Knead using the mixer and dough hook, on low to medium speed, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.  If you don't have a mixer, you can mix and knead by hand. If the dough seems a little too wet, sprinkle on a bit more flour.\n\n3 Place ball of dough in a bowl that has been coated lightly with olive oil.  Turn the dough around in the bowl so that it gets coated with the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit in a warm place (75-85°F) until it doubles in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours (or several hours longer, a longer rise will improve the flavor).  If you don't have a warm spot in the house you can heat the oven to 150 degrees, and then turn off the oven.  Let the oven cool till it is just a little warm, then place the bowl of dough in this warmed oven to rise. \n\nAt this point, if you want to make ahead, you can freeze the dough in an airtight container for up to two weeks.\n\nPreparing the Pizzas\n\n1 Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven.  Preheat the oven to 450°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour.\n\n2 Remove the plastic cover from the dough and punch the dough down so it deflates a bit.  Divide the dough in half.  Form two round balls of dough.  Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 10 minutes.\n\n3 Prepare your desired toppings.  Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.  About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza.  One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.\n\n\n\n4 Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a slightly floured work surface.  Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick.  Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.  Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to 12 inches.  Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker.  You can pinch the very edges if you want to form a lip.\n\n\n\n5 Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings).  Use your finger tips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling.  Let rest another 5 minutes.  \n\nRepeat with the second ball of dough.\n\n\n\n6 Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with corn meal.  Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.  If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.\n\n\n\n7 Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza.\n\n\n\n8 Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!).  Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.  Slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven.  Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes.  If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course! Well, not of course, actually. I didn’t think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as dad had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew Austin loves pizza. I told him if he helped me make it and didn’t make too many faces I would put him on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get his attention. He thought the dough was “slimy and gross” but he loved picking his own toppings, and the finished product was “awesome”.\n \nThe following method I patched together from recipes in both Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated’s The Best Recipe. I made two batches of dough, four pizzas in all, with varied toppings. Next time I’ll be a bit more patient with stretching out the dough so I can get it even thinner. Look to the end of this post for some excellent links about pizza from other food bloggers.\n
777	Lime Mango Sorbet	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the sugar, water, and lime zest in a medium saucepan until the sugar has completely dissolved.  Set aside to cool.\n\n2 Cut the flesh from the mangoes (see How to Cut a Mango).\n\n3 Put the mango pieces, sugar water, lime juice, and salt into a blender.  Blend until completely smooth.  Pour into a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely chilled.\n\n4 When ready to put the chilled lime mango purée into your ice cream maker, mix in the tequila.  Process the mixture in your ice cream maker (Amazon sells a good one) according to the ice cream maker directions.  Transfer mixture to a plastic storage container and freezer in your freezer until firm, at least 6 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Lime, mango, sugar, a dash of tequila. These ingredients are just destined to be together in a sorbet. Unlike lemon sorbet which can be quite tart, this lime mango sorbet has the smoothing influence of the mango. The addition of tequila not only adds a hint of margarita to the flavors, but helps keep the sorbet from getting icy.\n
724	Basic Tomato Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat olive oil in a large wide skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery and parsley. Stir to coat. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened and cooked through.\n\n2 Remove cover and add the minced garlic. Increase the heat to medium high. Cook for garlic for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, including the juice and shredding them with your fingers if you are using canned whole tomatoes. Add the tomato paste and the basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a low simmer, reduce the heat to low and cook, uncovered until thickened, about 15 minutes. If you want you can push the sauce through a food mill, or blend it with an immersion blender, to give it a smooth consistency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A good tomato sauce is the foundation for so many wonderful dishes – pizza, pasta, chicken, and fish. Here is a recipe for a basic tomato sauce that starts with a soffritto of onions, carrots, and celery cooked in a little olive oil, to which garlic, tomatoes and seasonings are added. Simple and delicious. The sauce can be dressed up with mushrooms, sausage, olives, wine, and all manner of vegetables. For a tantalizing version of a tomato-based sauce check out Sean’s sauce over at Hedonia. What’s your favorite tomato sauce recipe?\n
725	Caramelized Onion Quiche	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSlicing Onions Stem to Root\nTo caramelize onions, you'll want to slice them lengthwise, or from stem end to root end. That way the onions will hold their shape better during the long cooking involved in caramelizing.\n1 First, use a sharp knife, get a firm grip on the onion, and slice off the stem end of the onion, by about a 1/2 inch. Then place the onion cut side down on the board to stabilize it, and cut it in half, straight through the root end.\n2 Peel back the papery skin of the onions. If you want, to keep your cutting area clean, cut off the roots with the skins, but cut only enough to cut off the messy roots. Keep the root end intact. It will make it easier to slice the onion.\n3 With an onion half cut-side down on the board to stabilize it, make angled cuts into the onion, from stem end to root end, cutting to, but not through the root end. Work your way around the arc of the onion, aiming your knife's blade toward the center of the onion.\n\n4 Make a "V" cut in the root end of the onion to cut out the tough root end, to release the onion slices.\n\nPre-Baking the Crust\n1 On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-by-1 1/2-inch round tart pan, pressing dough into corners. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.\n2 Preheat oven to 350°. Line pastry with parchment paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges. Fill at least two-thirds with baking weights - dried beans, rice, or aluminum pie weights. Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper and weights. Poke the bottom of the pie pan with the tines of a fork and return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. (Fork holes are for any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making filling.\n \nCaramelizing the Onions and Preparing the Quiche\nThe onions will take about an hour to cook on the stovetop before they are ready to go into the quiche. So timing-wise, if you are making the entire quiche from scratch, it makes sense to get started on the onions once you've put the crust into the freezer to chill before pre-baking.\n1 Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. Add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned. Add balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.\n\n2 Place tart pan on a baking sheet to catch any run-off there might be. Sprinkle half the cheese evenly over the bottom of the crust. Spread onions over the cheese and then top with remaining cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, cream, and eggs. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Pour over cheese. Transfer to oven, and bake until just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes before slicing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Ever wake up in the morning with a craving for a specific food? This morning it was quiche, specifically an onion quiche. To my dear father who turned up his nose at this masterpiece, mumbling something about real men, I say, “phooey”. Kudos to my brother Ed, who almost made up for dad’s transgression, by saying just “damn good” after inhaling a piece at dinner.\n
726	Greek Meatballs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat a small pan over medium heat and add oil, garlic, jalapeño and shallot, and cook for 1 minute, then let cool.2 Meanwhile, crumble lamb into a large bowl. Evenly scatter salt pork, orange zest and mint over lamb, and season with pepper. Sprinkle the cooled garlic mixture over lamb. Gently mix until just combined, then form into 1¼-inch balls and transfer to a plate or sheet pan.\n\n3 Heat a large cast iron pan over medium to medium high heat.  Working in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, brown meatballs on all sides until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm with toothpicks or skewers with plain yogurt.\nNote: Meatballs can also be cooked ahead, refrigerated and reheated in the microwave on high for 2 minutes.\n\nMakes about 20 meatballs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I found this recipe in the weekend edition of the Wall St. Journal as good “noshing” food for New Year’s and had to give it a try, with a few minor changes. It comes from chef Michael Symon of the Parea Greek restaurant in New York and Lola & Lolita Bistro in Cleveland. The meatballs are quite tasty and work well dipped in a little yogurt.\n
727	Banana Nut Muffins	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo need for a mixer with this recipe. \n\n1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. With a wooden spoon, mix butter into the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl. \n\n2 Mix in the sugar, egg, espresso and vanilla. \n\n3 Sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the mixture and mix in. \n\n4 Add the flour, mix until it is just incorporated.  Fold in the chopped walnuts. \n\n5 Pour mixture into a prepared muffin tin. Bake for 25-30 minutes.  Check for doneness with a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin.  If it comes out clean, it's done. Cool on a rack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If time and waistline permitted, I could wake up every morning to the smell of fresh muffins baking in the oven, especially these banana nut muffins. This recipe is based on our popular banana bread recipe, with a little less sugar, a cup of chopped walnuts, and a dash of espresso. Lest you be tempted to snatch the muffins pictured here right out of your computer screen, you should know that they’ve long since been consumed, minutes after the photo was taken. ;-)\n
728	Italian Pot Roast	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Trim some of the fat from the meat.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Season generously with the salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, shimmering but not smoking, add the roast and cook, turning it a few times, until it is nicely browned on all sides, 10-12 minutes.  Transfer the meat to a platter.\n\n\n\n2 Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the carrot, celery, and onion.  Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are golden brown and begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, 10-12 minutes.  Add the garlic, parsley, and sage, and stir until the herbs are lightly colored and fragrant, about 1 minute.    Add 1 cup of the wine and stir quickly, lifting up the richly browned caramelized vegetables that stick to the bottom of the pan.  When the wine is almost all evaporated and thickly coats the vegetables, return the meat to the pan and turn it over a few times to coat it with the savory base.\n\n\n\n3 Raise the heat to high, adding the remaining wine, the bay leaf, and the tomatoes, and bring to a boil.  Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, turning and basting the meat every half hour or so, until the meat is very tender and flakes away when pierced with a fork, 3-4 hours.  Turn off the heat and let the roast sit in its juices for an hour.  (You can also put the pot into a 300°F oven and turn the roast every hour.)\n\n4 Remove the meat from the pot and place it on a cutting board, covered loosely with aluminum foil.  If the sauce is too thin, bring it to a fast boil and reduce it until it has a medium-thick consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning.\n\n5 Cut the meat into thick slices (it will probably fall apart), and place on warm serving dishes.  Spoon the sauce over the meat and serve hot.  Serve with rice, mashed potatoes, or polenta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A few weeks ago my mother and I attended a cooking demonstration by our local celebrity Italian chef, the delightful Biba Caggiano. We Sacramentans are proud to call Biba our own; she has a fabulous restaurant, is the author of several cookbooks, and for a while hosted her own cooking show on the Discovery Channel. One of the recipes Biba demonstrated during our evening with her was her “Stracotto di Manzo alla Fiorentina” or “The Braised Beef of Florence”. Biba, in her typical down-to-earth manner called it “nothing more than a glorified pot roast”. It’s a simple and delicious recipe, much like our standard pot roast but with a soffritto base, the addition of tomatoes, and a whole bottle of wine. \n
729	Ling Cod with Tomato and Orange	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and sauté for 5 minutes, until softened.  Add the olives, orange zest, orange segments, tomatoes, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n2 Add the fish to the pan.  Spoon sauce over the fish.  Cover and cook for an additional 7 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through.  Sprinkle with dill and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We recently found this recipe using halibut in Real Simple magazine and decided to give it a go, but with ling cod instead. Mom and I loved it, dad wasn’t so sure. For me, it was reminiscent of our favorite fish stew and was just as good the next day.\n
730	Becca’s Jambalaya	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the vegetables and shrimp.  It pays to get as much of the prep work done ahead of time, especially if you are making a large batch.  Note that Becca gets her shrimp fresh, not frozen, in the shell, and butterfly cut to make it easy to de-shell.  After chopping up all the vegetables, de-shelling the shrimp takes a bunch of time because you want to make sure to get all of the shell pieces out.  As you de-shell the shrimp, place the shrimp in a bowl of cold water.  When you are done de-shelling, strain the water from the shrimp and put the shrimp in the refrigerator to stay cold.  You will not add the shrimp to the jambalaya until the last 2 minutes of making this dish.\n\n2 In a large skillet, fry the sausage slices on medium heat, in batches, until cooked through, about 15 minutes for each batch.  As you finish each batch, pour out the sausage and whatever fat has been released into a large stockpot.  The size of the stockpot depends on how much jambalaya you are making. For a this batch, I would use an 8-Qt stockpot.\n\n3 Add Tony Chachere's Creole Jambalaya Dinner mix, and 2 1/4 cups of water for every box used.  Add Uncle Ben's long grain rice and 2 1/4 cups of chicken broth for every cup of rice used.  Add onions, bell peppers, and celery.  Slowly bring mixture to a simmer, on MEDIUM heat.  This is slow cooking.  You want it on medium to prevent the jambalaya from burning.  While the jambalaya is cooking, stir it every once in a while to make sure that nothing is sticking to the bottom.  \n\n4 Add bay leaves, garlic, whole tomatoes (reserve juice), diced tomatoes, tomato sauce.  Add thyme, tabasco, oregano, cayenne pepper.  Slow cook on medium heat adding tomato juice and stock as needed, as the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot.  You do not want it to get dried out, nor do you want it to be too liquidy.  At this point, stir often to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom.  Have the temperature be just a notch below a simmer.  If it begins to boil, lower the heat, or add water.  Cook slowly for an hour as the rice absorbs the liquid.\n\n Click on images for larger view.\n\nBecca with the Creole seasoning 5 While the jambalaya is cooking, taste frequently and adjust seasonings.  Becca likes her jambalaya pretty hot; she says, "If you're not sweat'n, it's not hot enough!"  She adds Tony Chacher's Creole seasoning to bring up the heat.  Add to taste.\n\nClick image for larger view.6 When the rice has absorbed as much moisture as it will, slowly fold in the shrimp.  Add lemon juice (1/2 a lemon for each lb of shrimp).  Cover and cook for 2 more minutes.  Remove from heat and you're done.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recently I spent an afternoon helping my friend Becca cook up a large batch of jambalaya. Becca is from Biloxi, Mississippi and has been making jambalaya for years.\n
731	Arugula Salad with Beets and Goat Cheese	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe amount of ingredients depends on how many people you are serving and how much salad you intend to serve them.  The important thing is that this is a good blend of flavors.  I didn't try tossing this salad; each plate was composed individually.\n\nThe dressing for three individual salads was 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/2 lemon, 1/4 teaspoon of powdered mustard, 3/4 teaspoon of sugar, salt and pepper to taste.  Actually, it is all to taste.  These are only approximate measurements.\n\nAssemble the salad according to how much you want.  A handful of arugula leaves, a few beet juliennes, some crumbled goat cheese, garnish with chopped walnuts.  Use a vinaigrette salad dressing or what I've described above.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Winter in California is the season for arugula, along with many other lettuces. A few years ago we planted some in our garden and now each year the arugula re-seeds itself and takes over with a flourish, starting in December. Arugula was popularized a few years ago as a central component of California cuisine. For those unfamiliar with it, it tastes a lot like watercress – peppery and slightly bitter. In this recipe the goat cheese mellows the pepperiness of the arugula, while the beets offer a sweet contrast to its bitter quality. Chopped walnuts add a little more texture to the salad.\n
732	Valentine Linzer Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cream butter in a standing electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Add sugar and continue creaming. Add the egg, lemon, and vanilla and mix. Mix in the ground nuts.\n2 Stir together dry ingredients in a bowl and add to mixer and blend. Form the dough into disks, wrap and chill.\n3 Roll out dough between two sheets of parchment paper to 1/8-inch thickness. Put rolled dough (still between parchment paper) in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to firm up before cutting.\n4 Preheat oven to 350°F.\n5 Cut out the base cookie shapes. Cut out the centers of half the disks with a smaller cookie cutter shape. Re-roll scraps and repeat.\n6 Bake for 12 minutes or until edges turn golden. Cool on a wire rack.\n7 Heat the jam or jelly and spread the solid disks with a layer of the hot preserves. Place the top layer cookie over the bottom, pressing down lightly. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, then fill the holes with more preserves. Let set slightly before serving.\nMakes 12-24 cookies, depending on the size of your cookie cutter shapes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Happy Valentine’s Day!\nWhy should chocolate have all the fun? Here are some Austrian Linzer cookies with a red preserve filling that seem perfectly suited for the occasion. Enjoy. :-)\n
733	Rose Petal Flan	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Have your ramekins ready, near the stove.  When you pour out the caramelized sugar you will want to work fast. Place the sugar and water in a small, thick-bottomed saucepan.  Heat on medium heat.  As the sugar beings to melt, gently stir with a wooden spoon to break up unmelted lumps.  Once the sugar has melted it will begin to turn golden and then darker brown.  As soon as it turns a strong shade of reddish brown, remove the pan from the heat, working quickly, evenly divide the sugar between the ramekins, coating the bottom of each ramekin.  Place the ramekins in a 2-inch deep baking dish. \n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°F.  In a small saucepan, on medium high heat, mix sugar and milk until the milk is warm to the touch and the sugar has completely dissolved (about 120°F).  Do not let the milk boil.  Remove from heat.  In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, egg yolks, vanilla and rose water.  Temper the egg mixture with a little (about 1/4 cup) of the warm milk mixture, whisking as you add the milk.   Add the egg mixture back into the pan of milk.  Lower the heat to low and whisk the egg mixture in for a minute until the egg mixture is fully incorporated.\n\n\n\n3 Pour custard mixture into the ramekins, up to about 1/4-inch from the top edge of the ramekins.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.\n\n4 Bake on the middle rack until centers of flans are gently set, about 45 minutes. Transfer flans to rack and cool. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead.)\n\n5 To serve, run small sharp knife around flan to loosen. Turn over onto plate. Shake gently to release flan. Carefully lift off ramekin allowing caramel syrup to run over flan. Repeat with remaining flans and serve.  If you have refrigerated the flan over night and the flan won't easily release, you can heat it in the microwave for a few seconds (10-15) to loosen it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever encountered a stubborn teenager who outright refuses to eat something new, in spite of everyone telling her how good it is? At some point you just give up and say, “oh have it your way, all the more for the rest of us.” I was that stubborn teenager one summer in Mexico City, surrounded by my host family pleading with me to try this weird looking dish that they had translated as “burnt milk”. I’m forever grateful my friend’s mother Señora Argüelles didn’t give up on me that day. After finally submitting to one bite, I ate all that remained in the pot. Ever since that day flan is one dessert that I simply cannot refuse.\nThis recipe makes a fabulous flan, giving you the scent of roses with every bite. (Perfect for Valentine’s Day, don’t you think?) The recipe is adapted from the cookbook Doña Tomàs: Discovering Authentic Mexican Cooking from the Doña Tomas restaurant in Oakland, California. \n
734	Creamy Shrimp and Broccoli Fettuccine	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Fill a large 8-quart stock pot at least half full with water and with 1 Tbsp of salt; bring to a boil.\n\n2 While the water is the large stockpot is heating, bring a smaller saucepan (2-3 quarts) half filled with water to a boil.  Blanch the broccoli in the boiling water for 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Drain and run the broccoli under cold water to stop the cooking.  Set aside.\n\n3 Cook the pasta in the large pot of boiling water according to the directions on the package (anywhere from 3 to 12 minutes, depending on the type of pasta you have) until al dente, or still slightly firm.  Drain and toss with a little olive oil to keep from sticking.\n\n4 While the pasta is cooking, combine the cream, wine, garlic, and black pepper in a large skillet and bring to a simmer over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 7 to 10 minutes until the mixture thickens.\n\n5  Add the shrimp and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until the shrimp have turned pink on all sides.  Toss in the broccoli and the parsley.  Mix in the fettucini. Salt to taste.\n\nServes 6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Shown cooked with brown rice pasta.\nWe were recently sent a review copy of Dave’s Dinners: A Fresh Approach to Home-Cooked Meals by Dave Lieberman of the Food Network. Honestly, I’ve never heard of Dave as I don’t watch much TV outside of House. That said, most of the recipes in his book look pretty good – interesting combinations of easy-to-find ingredients, nothing too complicated, perfect for home cooking. The following is an adaptation of Dave’s Creamy Shrimp Fettuccine recipe. I thought it needed a little more sauce and some greenery, hence the broccoli. It was quite good, and came together quickly. I can imagine lots of variations on the same theme (diced ham instead of shrimp, chopped kale in place of broccoli, or skip the broccoli all together). \n
735	Baby Bok Choy with Sherry and Prosciutto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put the oil and garlic into a large, heavy-based sauté pan with a lid.  Heat on medium high heat and cook, stirring frequently until the garlic begins to sizzle, about 1 minute.  \n\n2 Add the bok choy halves.  Use tongs to turn the pieces in the oil.  Season with salt.  When the bok choy leaves begin to wilt, add the sherry, turning the pieces again.  Add the chicken broth, soy sauce, and sugar.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Cover and simmer until the bok choy tops are wilted and the stalks are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer the bok choy to a plate, leaving the cooking fluid in the pan.\n\n3 Whisk the corn starch slurry into the cooking fluid.  Simmer until liquid has thickened, about 30 seconds.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the bok choy back to the pan.  Add the prosciutto and toss quickly to coat the bok choy with the broth and mix with the prosciutto.  Season to taste with salt.  Serve immediately.\n\nServes 4 to 6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I admit, I am not the greatest fan of bok choy, perhaps as result of too many poorly done stir-fries during college. That said, my father made this recipe from Fine Cooking the other day and it was so good I made a trip to the store just to get more baby bok choy and had him make it again. Perhaps it’s the addition of sherry and prosciutto? Likely. Do you like bok choy? If so, what’s your favorite recipe?\n
786	Horseradish Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMix ingredients together.  Serve as a sauce for steak or pork.\n\nMakes about 1/2 a cup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I grew up with horseradish, sometimes called “German mustard”, as a common accompaniment to steak and pork dishes. With dad’s German heritage, no wonder there was always a jar of it in the house. These days I suspect many people are more likely to eat wasabi, an unrelated Japanese condiment with similar effect, than horseradish; I just don’t see it around that much anymore. That said, horseradish sauce, made with prepared horseradish and either whipped cream or sour cream, tastes great with steak or roast pork. Here’s a sour cream version.\n
736	Danish Pork Burgers	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Using your hands to combine, mix together the pork, saltines, onion, eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.\n\n\n\n2  Lightly brush a large, nonstick frying pan with vegetable oil.  Heat the pan on medium high.  Divide the pork mixture into 8 equal portions.  Working in batches, drop each portion into the hot pan, spacing them as not to crowd the pan.  Pat them down with the back of a spoon to form them into patties.  Cook the patties, turning once, for 4 to 5 minutes per side, until golden brown.\n\nServe the pork burgers with Dijon mustard.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I met Iowa hog farmer Paul Willis at the Fancy Food Show in January and naturally our conversation turned to food and recipes. “Have you ever had a pork burger?,” Paul asked, eyes bright. Upon hearing my response in the negative, Paul added, “You have to try my wife Phyllis’ pork burgers. They’re amazing.” Thinking of burgers made out of pork, I can’t say I was convinced, even when he continued, “Everyone in Iowa eats pork burgers.” But when Paul pointed out his wife’s recipe in the Niman Ranch Cookbook I saw the light. These burgers aren’t hamburgers made out of ground pork. They are more like large, flattened Swedish meatballs. Very tasty. Thank you Paul and Niman Ranch, and thank you Phyllis for a fabulous recipe.\n
737	Spicy Chicken Drumsticks	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a food processor, purée the green onions, chilies, vinegar, garlic, thyme, allspice, salt and pepper into a thick paste.\n\n2 Put the drumsticks in a large bowl and coat with the chili paste.  Let stand for 10 minutes.\n\n3 Position the oven rack in the center of the oven and set the broiler to high.  Coat the bottom of a broiler pan (under the perforated top part of the pan) with oil.  (Note that a broiler pan really works best here. A regular baking pan may warp under the high heat of the broiler.) Arrange the drumsticks on the pan and sprinkle generously with salt.\n\n4 Broil chicken, turning once after about 10 minutes.  Continue broiling until cooked through (juices run clear when poked with a knife tip) and nicely browned, about 20 minutes total.   Note that some pieces may cook faster than others, in which case remove the pieces that are done and continue to cook the rest until cooked through.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We often cook all drumsticks or all thighs when we prepare chicken. We love the more flavorful dark meat and the fact that the chicken pieces all get done around the same time. The following recipe is based on one for jerk chicken that my father found in Fine Cooking magazine. Wonderful flavor and the drumsticks cook up quickly. \n
738	Spareribs and Sauerkraut	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Separate the ribs, and sprinkle them with salt. Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy pot on medium high heat. Add the ribs and brown them. Remove the ribs from the pot and add the chopped onion to the pot. Sauté the onions for 3 minutes. Then add the minced garlic for a minute more.\n2 Add sauerkraut and wine to the pot. Add just enough water to cover the ribs.  Add 10 juniper berries and a sprinkle of carraway seed to taste.\n3 Bring to boil and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer until the meat falls off of the bones, anywhere from one to two hours. Remove the bones and juniper berries. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nServe with boiled potatoes. Delicious with ketchup which creates a sweet contrast to the sour sauerkraut, or you can use whole grain mustard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Spareribs with sauerkraut is something I’ve never had outside of my own home. My father claims that there are restaurants in Minnesota (where he grew up) that serve them. But I certainly have never seen them as a menu item here in California. Too bad, too. They are the perfect dish for a cold winter day, served with ketchup over boiled potatoes. This is a German dish; my grandmother made spareribs this way and my father makes them this way. I suppose if you’ve never had spareribs and sauerkraut, they don’t look particularly appealing – what with the different shades of gray. But believe me, they are wonderful, especially with the ketchup.\n
739	Tex-Mex Lasagna	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large cast iron frying pan on medium high heat.  Add the ground meat, breaking it up as you add it.  Sprinkle with salt.  Sprinkle on the chile powder, cayenne, cumin, and coriander.  Increase the heat to high.  Add another 2 Tbsp of olive oil.  Do not stir the meat unnecessarily.   Allow it to brown on one side, and then stir it so the other side can be browned.  As soon as the meat is browned, remove the pan from the burner.  The meat will continue to cook in the heat of the cast iron pan.  Once you are sure that the meat is cooked through, use a slotted spoon to remove the meat from the pan to a bowl.  Set aside.\n\n2 While the meat is cooking, heat bacon fat in another frying pan on medium high.  Add the rinsed, drained cooked pinto beans to the pan.  Mash gently with a potato masher (careful if you are using a stick-free pan not to scratch the surface of the pan).  Stir in enough water so that the beans are easily thinly spreadable, about a half a cup.  Salt to taste.  Remove from heat and set aside.  Note you could skip this step by using canned refried beans than have been thinned with water.  We have found that the canned refried beans do not taste as good as rinsed canned whole beans that have been refried on the stovetop.  Best is to make the beans from scratch but not everyone has time for that.\n\n3 Once the meat is done cooking, and has been removed from the pan in step 1, add another Tbsp of olive oil to the pan and heat to medium.  Add the onions and chopped bell peppers, cook until onions have softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, cook for an additional 1 minute.  Add the diced tomatoes, green chilies and oregano.  Bring to a simmer.  Simmer gently for 15-20 minutes while you prepare the tortillas.\n\n\n\n4 In a 9-inch skillet, heat 1/2 cup olive oil on medium high heat until it is sizzling hot, but not smoking.  Cook the tortillas one at a time, for 5 seconds on each side, so that they soften, but don't get crisp.  Remove with tongs and place on a plate lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil.\n\n5 Preheat oven to 350°F and lightly oil a 13x9x3-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.\n\n6 In baking dish arrange 4 tortillas in one layer, overlapping slightly (tortillas will not cover bottom completely). Spread half of bean mixture evenly over tortillas in dish and top with half of meat mixture. Sprinkle one third cheese over the meat and spread half of the sauce over the cheese.\n\nRepeat layering of tortillas, beans, meat, cheese, and sauce and top with remaining 4 tortillas. Sprinkle remaining cheese over tortillas. Bake casserole on the middle rack in the oven for 35 minutes, until the casserole is heated through and the cheese is completely melted and bubbling.  Let the casserole stand for 10-15 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\nServes 8.  Serve with sour cream, chopped avocado, chopped cilantro, and thinly sliced iceberg lettuce on which has been sprinkled vinegar and salt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tex-Mex “Lasagna” (also known as “Mexican Casserole” or “Mexican Lasagna”) is called such because like the Italian lasagna we know and love, the Tex-Mex version is a baked casserole dish comprised of layers. Only in true Tex-Mex fashion, we are using corn tortillas in place of lasagna noodles, salsa instead of sauce, beans in place of béchamel, and mild cheddar and jack instead of ricotta and Parmesan. As you can imagine, it is a filling dish with all the makings of enchiladas, tacos, and tostadas in one place. Perfect with guacamole and sour cream. Great for potlucks and large gatherings of hungry people.\n
740	Snow Peas with Pine Nuts and Mint	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add the snow peas, garlic, and pine nuts. Stir to coat with the oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring. You do not want to overcook the snow peas or they will get limp. They should still be a little bit crunchy.\n2 Remove from heat. Stir in the sesame oil and chopped mint leaves. Serve immediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Spring has sprung here in Northern California. The sweet peas are blossoming, the snap peas are climbing, and I have peas on my brain! Today I had a hankering for snow peas and cooked up a bunch this afternoon just for the heck of it. There are so many ways to prepare snow peas, the only thing you really don’t want to do is to over-cook them. This is a simple stir-fry with pine nuts, garlic, sesame oil, and a little mint. What’s your favorite snow peas recipe?\n
741	Salmon Fish Stew, Brazilian Style	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix together the marinade ingredients.  Let the salmon marinate in this paste for at least 2 hours.  The longer, the better.  \n\n\n\n2 In a large pan (large covered skillet or Dutch oven), coat the bottom of the pan with a couple tablespoons of olive oil.  Add a layer of sliced onions, and then a layer of sliced bell peppers, and a layer of sliced tomatoes.  Place the fish pieces, with the marinade, on top of everything, and start layering again - onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Add about half of your fresh cilantro to the top.  Pour coconut milk over the top.  Drizzle generously with olive oil over the top (several tablespoons).\n\n\n\n3 Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 30 minutes to an hour, until the vegetables are cooked through.\n\nServe with rice; garnish with remaining cilantro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	In Bahia in Northern Brazil, there is a savory fish stew called “Moqueca” that they make with local fish. Fernanda Guimaraes Rosa, who writes the Brazilian food blog Chucrute com Salsicha, brought a Vancouver friend’s salmon version of Moqueca to party a while ago, and it was wonderful, my favorite dish of the day. The salmon is marinated first with lime juice, paprika, and cumin, and then simmered with onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers, in coconut milk. It was even better the next day.\n
742	Pavlova	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 275°. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour the vanilla and vinegar (if using) into a small cup. Stir the cornstarch into the sugar in a small bowl.\n\n\n\n2 In a large bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, fitted with whisk attachment, whip egg whites, cream of tartar (if using) and salt, starting on low, increasing incrementally to medium speed until soft peaks/trails start to become visible, and the egg white bubbles are very small and uniform, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.\n\n\n\n3 Increase speed to medium-high, slowly and gradually sprinkling in the sugar-cornstarch mixture. A few minutes after these dry ingredients are added,  slowly pour in the vanilla and vinegar (if you didn't use cream of tartar.) Increase speed a bit and whip until meringue is glossy, and stiff peaks form when the whisk is lifted, 4 to 5 minutes.  \n\n\n\n4 Pipe or spoon the meringue into 8-10 large round mounds that are 3 inches wide on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicon liner.  With the back of a spoon, create an indentation in the middle of the mound for holding the filling once meringue is baked.\n\n\n\n5 Place baking sheet in the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 250°F.  Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the meringues are crisp, dry to the touch on the outside, and white -- not tan-colored or cracked. The interiors should have a marshmallow-like consistency. Check on meringues at least once during the baking time. If they appear to be taking on color or cracking, reduce temperature 25 degrees, and turn pan around.\n\n6 Gently lift from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack.  Will keep in a tightly sealed container at room temperature, or individually wrapped, for up to a week if your house is not humid.\n\n7 Served topped with your favorite filling - lemon curd, raspberry or blueberry sauce, and freshly whipped cream.\n\nRecipe adapted from Flo Baker's pavlovas in the San Francisco Chronicle: Fourth of July dessert has roots in Australia\n\nSauce or Filling Directions\n\nIf you want to make a berry sauce, heat a couple pints of fresh or frozen berries in a medium saucepan with about a quarter cup of sugar.  Heat on medium heat, stirring once or twice, for about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how much the berries are falling aprt. Remove from heat and let cool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome pastry chef extraordinaire Shuna Fish Lydon of Eggbeater who is our guest author for this article on Pavlovas. ~Elise\nIt’s no coincidence the late Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, for whom the Pavlova dessert was named, is said to have been ethereal, delicate and slightly controversial. Her namesake, this simple confection, is a straightforward enough list of ingredients, but the end result is all about touch, finesse. And it has attracted more than its fair share of controversy. Two distinct neighboring countries take credit for invention and creation. For sake of staying neutral, we will say both New Zealand and Australia are to blame for the delicious Pavlova; an edible translation of sugar turned into cumulous clouds, it is one of the best low fat vehicles for seasonal fruit, whipped cream, sorbet, and ice cream.\nWhether you hail from Australia, New Zealand or elsewhere, I hope you’ll attempt this gorgeous recipe. It’s a delightful dessert any time of year.\n Working with Egg Whites\nSweet, crunchy, and meltingly soft, Pavlova is a reason for understanding the fickle, hard working, all-purpose egg white.\nYou create your best egg white-based confections when you know how to treat this important part of the egg. An egg white is pure protein. When room temperature to begin with, egg whites will grow bigger and stronger with whipping. For this reason it’s best to start whipping egg whites on a lower speed, increasing incrementally as you get to the aspired consistency. I like to say I’m cajoling my egg whites into submission. \nTo achieve room temperature egg whites, take eggs out the night before you need them, or place in a bowl of warm water for about 10 minutes to take their chill off.\nMake sure all bowls, hands, and utensils touching egg whites are as clean and free of random oils as possible. When separating eggs, crack in half and gently toss the yolk back and forth between the eggshell halves, dripping egg white out into a clean container. If a bit of yolk drops into your pristine whites, fish it out with a clean eggshell. Hint: if a bit of shell gets in, they will sink to the bottom and be easy to spot and hold back when it comes time to use the egg whites.\nNot sure what to do with the leftover egg yolks? Most custards like pastry cream or stovetop pudding are egg yolk based.\n
743	Rice Pilaf	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Look at the cooking instructions for your rice.  If your rice calls for 2 cups of water for every cup of rice then you will need a total of 4 cups of liquid.  If your rice calls for 1 2/3 cups of water for every cup of rice, you will need a total of 3 1/3 cups of liquid.   \n\nYou want to cook the rice in a liquid that is primarily stock - chicken stock or vegetable stock.  Up to half of the liquid can be plain water, but at least half of the needed liquid should be stock.  Homemade stock is the best, of course, and will make a big difference in the quality of the resulting pilaf.\n\nHeat the measured amount of stock needed in a saucepan, at least 2-qt sized.\n\n2 While the stock is heating, heat a large skillet on medium high heat.  Add the chicken fat (or oil), melting it so it coats the bottom of the pan.  Add the uncooked rice and brown the rice, stirring occasionally, for a couple of minutes.  Add the onions and celery and cook a few minutes longer, until the onions begin to soften.\n\n3 If you are using canned or boxed broth, be careful of how much seasoning you add.  We usually use homemade, unsalted chicken stock, so we add 2 teaspoons of Vegesal (can use plain salt or other seasoned salt) along with ground pepper and a dash of cayenne.  If you are starting with seasoned broth, you may only need to add a teaspoon of Vegesal or salt.  Taste test the broth/stock.  It can be a little on the salty side because the rice will absorb a lot of the salt.  \n\n4 Carefully empty the slightly browned rice into the saucepan with the stock.  Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat, cover, and cook for as long as the instructions say on your package of rice.  Usually between 15 to 25 minutes.  Use a timer.  After the set amount of cooking time, remove the pan from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes, covered.  At no point during the cooking of the rice should you uncover the pan.\n\nNote that you could also pour the stock into the pan with the rice, cover and cook.  This is the more usual way to make pilaf.  We have found however more consistent results by pouring the rice into the saucepan of stock.\n\nFluff with a fork to serve.  Stir in chopped parsley.  You can also mix in heated peas,  toasted almonds, or raisins to the pilaf to make it more interesting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Trying to get a recipe out of my mother is like pulling teeth. Mom doesn’t follow recipes. After 50 years of cooking for her family she doesn’t need to. She cooks instinctively, pulling ingredients from what we have on hand, making substitutions or additions as she sees fit. Taste testing here and there for a little more of this or that. To get a recipe out of her I have to watch her make something, take copious notes, and ask a lot of questions. For each seemingly innocuous question, there can be a dissertation’s worth of answers. “Well, Adele Davis did it this one way, Diane Kennedy did it this other way, and I do it this way because (fill in the blank… my pot is too big, I’m using an electric range, we don’t have any fresh cilantro.. etc. etc.)” My mother is never one to give someone the time when a thorough explanation of how the watch works and how they made clocks in China 2000 years ago will do. (Mom is a treasure trove of knowledge and I will never catch up to her, even if I cook every day for the next 40 years.)\n \nHere is how my mother makes her rice pilaf. It isn’t a precise recipe because much depends on the type of rice and the type and amount of stock you have. But then again, rice pilaf is one of those foundation dishes that you can dress up in many different ways.\n
744	Buttermilk Biscuits with Goat Cheese and Chives	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Line 2 heavy baking sheets with silpat or parchment paper. \n\n\n\n2 Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, baking soda, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Using fingertips, rub butter into dry ingredients until coarse meal forms.  Stir in the chives.  Add cheese and buttermilk; stir with fork just until a sticky dough forms (bits of cheese will be visible in dough).\n\n\n\n3 Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently 8 times with floured hands. Do not over-knead! Form into a round, about 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Cut the round into 8 wedges.  Use a pastry brush to brush on some extra buttermilk over the surface of the wedges.\n\n\n\n4 Arrange wedges about 1/2 inch apart on an ungreased large baking sheet and bake in middle of oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on a rack. \n\nBest eaten just baked and warm, with a little butter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Ever wonder what the difference is between scones and biscuits? The light, sweet scones enjoyed in England are nothing like the heavy, somewhat dry scones we usually have here in the states. They are more like our biscuits, but sweet. Of course “biscuit” in England means what we here would call a cookie. So confusing.\nI set out to make a light, savory scone, and in the process learned that, at least here in America, what I was making would more normally be called a biscuit. Here, therefore, is a recipe for delicious buttermilk biscuits, made with goat cheese and chives, and shaped into wedges (the shape of American scones). You can shape them any which way you like. Oh yes, and as for the difference between scones and biscuits? Here in America, scones tend to be a little heavier and drier, made with an egg, sweet, and usually including fruit such as cranberries or raisins. Biscuits are usually savory, light and fluffy, and made with buttermilk. But the distinctions are blurry, even here.\n
745	Grasshopper Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 425°F.  In a bowl, mix crushed oreo cookie halves and butter. Pat into bottom and sides of 10 inch pie dish. Bake in oven for 5 to 10 minutes; remove from oven and cool completely.  Once cooled, place in freezer to chill.\n\n2  In saucepan, melt marshmallows in milk over medium heat. Remove from heat and cool. Add creme de menthe and creme de cacao, and mix well. Add a drop or two of green food dye if desired.  Fold in whipped cream.     Pour into chilled pie shell.  Freeze for 3 or 4 hours.\n\nServe with a dollop of whipped cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My grandmother, on my dad’s side, had an amazing sweet tooth. How that woman could eat as many jelly-filled donuts as she did and still live to 97, I’ll never know. One of her favorite pies to make for us was grasshopper pie, a chilled minty green pie with an oreo cookie crust. I haven’t found her recipe, but my father patched one together from many he found online that turns out a pie just like the one she used to make. Many grasshopper pie recipes are quite elaborate and call for gelatin, egg yolks, egg whites, etc. In this recipe we use marshmallows, instead of the eggs and gelatin.\n
746	Sesame-Orange Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Heat a small skillet on medium high heat. Add the sesame seeds. Toast sesame seeds until fragrant and lightly browned. Do not turn your back on the seeds while cooking, they can easily and quickly burn. Stir often to keep them from burning. You may hear them pop, and some of them may hop out of the pan while cooking. When lightly browned remove from heat and set aside.\n2 Mix melted butter in with the bread crumbs. Heat a large skillet on a medium high, add the bread crumbs, stir often until the bread crumbs get toasty brown. Remove from heat, let cool.\n\n3 Heat the oven to 400°F. Line a roasting pan with foil. Put a flat baking rack on the lined roasting pan.\n4 Use a meat pounder to lightly pound the chicken breasts between two pieces of wax paper to even out the thickness of the breasts.\n5 Use a microplane grater to grate the zest from the orange. Place the zest in a large bowl. Cut 4 thin round slices from the center of the orange to use with this recipe. Save the rest of the orange for snacking.\n6 Add to the large bowl with the zest, the marmalade, soy sauce, sesame oil, peanut oil, red pepper flakes and salt. Mix well. Add the chicken to the sauce, coating every piece. You can at this point make ahead by 24 hours and let the chicken marinate, or you can go ahead with the recipe.\n\n7 In a large, shallow dish, mix together the toasted sesame seeds and bread crumbs. Working with the chicken one piece at a time, dredge the chicken in the coating, pressing down on the crumbs to make sure they adhere well. Transfer to the backing rack on the lined roasting pan. Dip the orange slices in the leftover marmalade mix and set on the rack.\n8 Cook at 400°F until the chicken has an internal temperature of 160°F, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately, topped with the orange slices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here’s a fun way to add a lot of flavor to breaded chicken breasts – cover them with orange marmalade, sesame oil, soy sauce and honey, and coat them with toasted sesame seeds. With all the jamming I do, we are practically swimming in marmalade this time of year. Who says marmalade is just for buttered toast? It makes an easy and delicious coating for chicken too.\n
748	Seville Orangeade	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cut the oranges in half lengthwise and then slice them into thin 1/8-inch slices.\n2 Put them in a large flat-bottomed non-reactive bowl. Stir in the sugar. Use a potato masher to mash the orange slices until most of the segments are juiced.\n3 Pour water into the bowl of orange slices. Stir to mix gently, making sure that any undissolved sugar gets completely dissolved. Stir in the lemon juice.\n4 Set a large fine mesh strainer over another large bowl and strain the orange mixture through it, pressing if necessary to get out as much of the juice as possible. Pour into a serving pitcher.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Remember Tang, the orange drink of astronauts? This sort of reminds me of Tang, or what Tang would taste like if it were made from fresh, whole ingredients. Or for those of us who outgrew Tang, think, Orangina but without the carbonation. Marc from Mental Masala introduced this recipe to me for whole lemon lemonade and I decided to try out the method with a bunch of leftover bitter Seville oranges I had from making marmalade. Bitter oranges are needed to make this orangeade recipe, it doesn’t really work with juice oranges, so I apologize in advance to those of you who don’t live in citrus growing regions. Here in California navel oranges are often grafted onto bitter orange root stock which is hardy. Sometimes the root stock takes over the orange tree and one year you find yourself with bitter seedy Seville oranges growing on your tree instead of sweet, seedless navel oranges. Most people don’t have the patience for marmalade making, for which these oranges are ideally suited. This is an easy way to use up those otherwise ignored oranges and make a delicious, refreshing drink at the same time. Would be good for an orange sorbet as well.\n
749	Dad’s English Muffin Pizzas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 425°F.\n\n2 Melt butter in a medium skillet on medium high heat.  Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the diced ham, cook 5 minutes more. Mix in the sage and mustard.  Remove from heat.\n\n3 Put muffin halves, open side up on a sturdy baking pan.  Distribute the cheese evenly, sprinkling over the muffin halves.  Put the onion ham mixture on top of the cheese.  If you want to use tomato slices, layer them between the cheese and onion mixture.\n\n4 Bake at 425°F for 8-9 minutes, until the muffins and toppings are nicely browned, but not burnt.  Cut into quarters for appetizers or just leave whole for a meal or snack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Back in 7th grade home-economics, the cooking segment consisted of learning how to make pizza with English muffins, some spaghetti sauce, a little cheese and a toaster oven. \n \nRelax. These aren’t those pizzas. These are cool, a little fancy, English muffin pizzas. When my father came home with a bag of English muffins announcing that he was going to make pizzas with them, I sort of rolled my eyes and stepped away. (Okay, dad, whatever you want.) But when the aroma of caramelizing onions, ham, bubbling Mozzarella wafted through the house, I got my plate ready. We’ll be having these again soon. \n
750	Spinach	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cut off the thick stems of the spinach and discard. Clean the spinach by filling up your sink with water and soaking the spinach to loosen any sand or dirt. Drain the spinach and then repeat soaking and draining. Put the spinach in a salad spinner to remove any excess moisture.\n2 Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add the garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, until the garlic is just beginning to brown.\n\n3 Add the spinach to the pan, packing it down a bit if you need to with your hand. Use a couple spatulas to lift the spinach and turn it over in the pan so that you coat more of it with the olive oil and garlic. Do this a couple of times. Cover the pan and cook for 1 minute. Uncover and turn the spinach over again. Cover the pan and cook for an additional minute.\n\n4 After 2 minutes of covered cooking the spinach should be completely wilted. Remove from heat. Drain any excess moisture from the pan. Add a little more olive oil, sprinkle with salt to taste. Serve immediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Popeye was the best thing that ever hit the spinach industry. When I was a kid you couldn’t pay me to eat lima beans or peas, but spinach? I begged for it; we all did. Especially if it came from a can. We wanted to be cool like Popeye, who could knock Bluto to Kingdom Come just by downing a can of spinach, which always conveniently found its way to Popeye’s mouth when his situation was most dire. Our parents worked hard to convince us that cooked fresh spinach was just as good, if not better than the canned stuff.\n\nMy father prepares spinach this way at least once or twice a week, usually made with fresh spinach from the farmer’s market. According to dad he overcooked it for years, until he learned that you shouldn’t cook spinach beyond the point that it just wilts. The trick is to drain and dry the spinach leaves as well as you can, using a salad spinner if need be, before cooking them. His spinach is fabulous, I hope you give it a try.\n
751	Panko-crusted Salmon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 400°F (convection or regular).  Set the salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet skin side down.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n\n2 In a small bowl, combine the honey mustard and 1 teaspoon of the thyme.  In another small bowl, mix the panko with the remaining 1 teaspoon of thyme, 4 teaspoons of olive oil, parsley, and paprika.  Add salt and pepper (a light sprinkle).\n\n3 Using a small spoon, spread the mustard mixture on the salmon; top with the bread crumb mixture.\n\n4 Roast the salmon for 12-14 minutes (test at 10) or until it is almost completely firm to the touch and flakes when poked with a fork.  Serve at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Panko is a Japanese type of bread crumb that is especially light and crunchy, popular these days with chefs because it doesn’t get soggy. What I love about this way of preparing salmon is that the panko topping seems to hold in the salmon’s moisture while roasting, so the salmon doesn’t get dried out at all. The salmon is perfectly moist, flakey, and seasoned.\n
752	Chicken, Mushrooms, and Tomatoes with Port Wine	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.\n\n2 Drop garlic into a small saucepan of boiling water, cook for 5 minutes, set aside.\n\n3 Heat butter in a heavy skillet and add chicken pieces.  Cook over medium high heat until lightly browned on one side, about 1 minute.  Turn and cook about 1 minute on the second side.  Add mushrooms and cook, turning chicken occasionally, about 2 minutes.\n\n4 Add shallots and the garlic cloves.  Add Port wine, tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.  Transfer chicken and tomatoes to a warm platter.  Cook sauce down a minute or two.  Pour onto chicken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This is one of my father’s favorite chicken recipes. We don’t make it nearly often enough.\n
753	Coffee Oreo Cookie Mount Gay Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 1 cup of the cream, 1 cup of milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan on medium heat until steaming, but not boiling.  Stir in the instant coffee until it is dissolved.\n\n2  Pour the remaining 1 cup of cream into a medium size metal bowl, set in an ice water bath in a larger bowl. Set a mesh seive on top of the bowls. Set aside.\n\n3 In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks together. Slowly pour the heated milk, cream, coffee mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm milk, but not cooked by it. Pour the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan. \n\n4 Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof, flat-bottomed spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run. Be patient.  This step can take 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n5 Pour the custard through the seive and stir it into the chilled cream.  Chill mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator.\n\n6 When thoroughly chilled and ready to put into your ice cream maker, add the rum and the crushed oreo cookies.  Process the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the ice cream maker directions.  Transfer mixture to a plastic storage container and freezer in your freezer until firm, at least 6 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Some things, prepared with delightful results in the exuberance of our youth, when made again 10, or 20 years later, don’t quite live up to the blissful memory. This coffee, oreo cookie, Mount Gay ice cream is not one of those things. It is as good as my dear friend Heidi H remembers it, when she made it with friends in an old fashioned, hand cranked ice cream maker decades ago. Heidi and I made a batch of this ice cream together recently with the new ice cream maker I got for her for her birthday. She will tell you that I was slightly skeptical at first. “Are you sure this isn’t something that was good just because you all were clearly enjoying the Mount Gay rum?” At first taste I was an instant convert. This is a great ice cream combination. Leave out the rum if you must, but keep it in if you can; its flavor addition is important. Note that in this recipe the oreo cookies are added before the ice cream is made, so that they almost completely disintegrate into the ice cream. You can fold them in after the ice cream is made if you want.\n
754	Honey Glazed Lemon Roast Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Marinate chicken in the lemon juice in sealable plastic bag, placed in a large bowl, so that if it leaks it will leak into the bowl. Refrigerate several hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally so that the chicken stays well coated with the lemon juice.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 450°F. Drain chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the exterior of the chicken and the cavity generously with salt and pepper. Place thyme sprigs into the cavity. Place chicken breast side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and roast for 45 minutes more.\n\n\n\n3 Turn chicken breast side up on the rack. Use a basting brush or pastry brush to coat the chicken all over with honey. Lower the heat to 350°F and continue to cook until cooked through and deep brown, basting with any juices in pan and brushing with honey occasionally, about 55 minutes longer (test for doneness starting about 40 minutes). The chicken is done when the juices run clear (not pink) when a knife tip is inserted into both the chicken breast and thigh, about 165-170°F for the breast and 180-185°F for the thigh. Transfer chicken to platter. Tent loosely with aluminum foil to keep the chicken warm. Let rest for 15 minutes before carving.\n\n4 Pour the pan juices into small saucepan. Spoon off fat. Reheat the pan juices. If you want you can thicken with a little flour or corn starch (create a slurry with corn starch or flour and a little water first, before adding to the pan juices).  Season with salt and pepper. Serve chicken with pan juices or thickened gravy.\n\nServes 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This honey-glazed lemon chicken is a very simple roast chicken recipe that we found in an old issue of Bon Appétit. The lemon juice marinade tenderizes the chicken while the honey glaze adds a sweet balance to the lemon.\n
755	Italian Sausage and Mushroom Risotto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle a little salt on the pan (will help prevent sticking). Add the sausage. Do not stir, but allow to brown on one side for a couple minutes.  Then stir and allow to brown a little more.  Add the mushrooms, thyme, and oregano and cook until mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the Madeira and scrape to deglaze the pan, about 1 minute. Set aside.\n\n2 Heat chicken stock until it is steamy or simmering in a large saucepan and keep warm over low heat.\n\n\n\n3 Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice; stir 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup Madeira.  Cook, stirring constantly until Madeira has been absorbed, about 2 minutes. Ladle in a little hot stock, just enough to barely cover the rice; simmer until almost absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook until rice is just tender and mixture is creamy, adding more stock by ladlefuls, stirring often and allowing most stock to be absorbed before adding more, until rice is tender, but still firm to the bite, about 20-25 minutes. \n\n\n\n4 Stir in sausage mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl. Sprinkle with cheese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Sometimes I’ll mention a recipe to my father, and if it starts with the words “Italian sausage” I don’t think it matters that much what words comes after, he’s already sold. We recently made this risotto recipe together; dad did the provisioning, the mushroom prep, and sausage cooking, while I sat on a stool stirring the risotto for a half an hour while the rice slowly absorbed the stock, a cupful at a time. Making risotto requires patience, it cannot be rushed. The rice will only absorb so much liquid at a time; it is the perfect “slow food”. Neither one of us counts patience as a virtue, but perhaps I have a little more when it comes to the long, slow stirring that this dish requires, so that’s the job I happily take. \n
785	Grilled Marinated Flank Steak	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Score the surface of the steak with 1/4 inch deep knife cuts, about an inch apart, across the grain of the meat.  Combine the marinade ingredients.  Place steak and marinade ingredients in a large freezer bag.  Coat the steak well with the marinade.  Seal the bag and place in a bowl.  Chill and marinate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n\n2 Using olive oil soaked onto a paper towel, coat the grill rack of your grill with olive oil.  Preheat the grill with high, direct heat.  The grill is hot enough when you hold your hand about an inch over it and you can only hold it there for about a second.  \n\n3 Take the steak out of the marinade bag and sprinkle generously on all sides with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper.  The salt and pepper will help form a savory crust on the steak.   Place steak on the hot grill.  If you are using a gas grill, cover the grill.  Grill for 4-6 minutes on each side.  Half way through grilling on each side, turn the steak 90° so that you get more grill marks.   \n\nHow do you know if the steak is done?  The best way to tell is to poke it with your finger tips.  While the steak is still raw, test it with your fingers; it will be quite squishy.  That's what a very rare steak feels like. As the steak cooks the muscles contract and firm up.  Touch the tip of your nose and that's what a very well done steak feels like.  Here's a visual guide, the finger test to check the doneness of steak.\n\n4 Flank steak is best eaten medium rare; well done will make it too tough.  When the steak has cooked to your preferred level of doneness, remove from the grill and place on a cutting board.  Cover with aluminum foil to hold in the heat and to keep the steak from drying out, and let rest for 10 minutes.\n\n5 Make very thin slices, against the grain, and at a slight diagonal so that the slices are wide.\n\nIf you want, you can take the excess marinade and bring it to a boil, simmer for several minutes, and serve with the flank steak.  Great also with salsa or horseradish sauce.\n\nServes 6. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Flank steak is a lean, somewhat tough but flavorful cut of beef that benefits from the tenderizing effects of a marinade. It is best cooked medium rare and thinly sliced at an angle. It actually could be sliced even more at a diagonal than what I’ve shown here in the photo. My father is the real expert around here at making beautiful thin slices, not I.\nPrepared this way, marinated, cooked quickly at high heat, thinly sliced, flank steak practically melts in your mouth. This recipe calls for grilling the steak, but if you don’t have a grill, you can prepare the steak on a large cast iron frying pan as well. I recently updated the marinade recipe based on a few suggestions from our readers. Thank you! There are more marinade ideas in the links to other food blogs at the bottom of the recipe. For more Southwestern flavors, see our carne asada recipe. Do you have a favorite flank steak marinade? or grilling trick for flank steak? If so, please let us know in the comments. \n
756	Crunchy French Toast	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or Silpat.\n\n2 Put the bread pieces on a lined baking sheet into the warming oven (it does not need to be at full temperature) to toast lightly for 5 minutes.  Cool the bread completely.\n\n3 Seal the cornflakes in a heavy plastic bag.  Crush them with a rolling pin to the size of rolled oats.  Pour into a pie pan or a shallow dish.  Set aside.\n\n\n\n4 In a large bowl, whisk to mix the eggs, milk, flour and vanilla until blended.  Be sure there are no lumps of unmixed flour.  Pour into a pie pan or shallow dish.  In batches, lay the bread pieces in the egg mix.  Soak about 1 minute on each side in the egg mixture. Be careful not to rip the bread.  \n\n\n\n5 Place the bread pieces in the cornflake crumbs.  Coat both sides with the crumbs.  Place on the lined baking sheet.\n\n\n\n6 Bake at 400°F for 10 minutes on one side.  Then flip over with tongs or a spatula and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, until the crumbs begin to turn brown.  Eat warm with butter and pancake syrup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	On a recent visit with my goddaughter Piper and her sisters Alden and Reilly, the girls surprised me one morning by making me their favorite version of French toast for breakfast – a “crunchy” French toast coated with corn flakes (actually a Corn flakes like cereal with dried blueberries in it) and baked in the oven. The three sisters, ages 4, 7, and 9, did everything to prepare this meal, while I sat astounded, watching them, lifting not a finger to help. These little French toast squares were actually quite good, especially with butter and real maple syrup. The recipe comes from a book they received for Christmas – Kitchen for Kids. Thank you girls!

791	Berry Cobbler with Coconut Walnut Topping	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Butter a 9x9 inch baking dish.\n\n2 In a large bowl, mix together the filling ingredients - berries, sugar, tapioca, and lemon juice.  Pour into the baking dish.\n\n3 In a medium sized bowl, stir together the flour, coconut, sugar, walnuts, baking powder and salt from the topping ingredients.  Use your fingers to mix in the cubes of butter.  Rub the butter into the other ingredients until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.\n\n4 Sprinkle the topping over the filling.  Bake for 35-40 minutes, until the topping is golden brown and crispy, and the filling is bubbling.  \n\n5 Let cool for at least an hour.  Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.\n\nMakes 6 servings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Not much that grows in our garden is available for picking in the spring. The first sign that the summer season is upon us and that the parade of glorious fruit is about to begin is when the boysenberries ripen on their vines. The berries are ripe and juicy now, and the deepest shade of purply black. With a berry mix from Trader Joe’s, our boysenberries, and some fresh strawberries from the market, my father whipped up this crunchy berry cobbler. Pretty, isn’t it? Summer weather has arrived; let the good times roll.\n
757	German Farmer’s Breakfast	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Boil the potatoes in a saucepan of lightly salted water for 10-15 minutes until just cooked (test for doneness).  Drain, rinse with cold water to cool. Cut into 1-inch squares.  Set aside.\n\n2 Heat 2 Tbsp bacon fat (or olive oil) in a large skillet on medium high heat.  Add the onions and chopped bell peppers.  Increase the heat to high.  Brown the onions and bell peppers, stirring frequently, about 2-3 minutes.  \n\n\n\n3 Push the vegetables to the side of the pan, add the potatoes and another Tbsp of bacon fat (or olive oil) to the pan.  Brown the potatoes for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Sprinkle on salt to taste as you cook.  Add the ham to the potatoes and cook, stirring frequently until the ham is heated through, 1-2 minutes.  \n\n\n\n4 Mix all of the vegetables, potato and ham together and mix in the parsley.  Add the eggs, stirring to distribute the eggs among the vegetables and ham.    As soon as eggs begin to firm up, remove from heat.\n\n\n\nServe immediately.  Great with ketchup on top.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of my mother’s favorite breakfasts to prepare for our family has always been German Farmer’s Breakfast, also known as Bauernfruhstuck. I remember eating this several times a month as a kid. It’s sort of like a large breakfast hash of potatoes and ham or bacon, with onions and bell pepper and some egg mixed in. It’s a hearty meal, and I imagine just the sort of breakfast that a German farmer might eat. Our last name being Bauer, no wonder we like foods like this. I love mine with a lot of ketchup. A great use of leftover ham.\n
758	Tamale Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F.\n2 Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium high. Add the ground beef, onion, and bell pepper. Add salt, chile powder, and cumin. Cook, stirring infrequently, until the ground beef has browned on all sides. Remove from heat. Drain excess fat if necessary (if you are using lean beef, there shouldn't be excess).\n\n3 Mix in fire-roasted tomatoes, Anaheim chiles, corn, olives, raisins, cheese, and water. Adjust seasoning. Add more chile powder and cumin if desired. Rub a little olive oil over the insides of a 9x12-inch casserole dish (or use a nonstick cooking spray). Spoon filling into the casserole dish.\n\n4 In a large bowl, prepare the cornbread batter according to the directions on the package. Pour the cornbread batter over the top of the filling in the casserole.\n\n5 Bake for 40 minutes, until the top is browned.\nServes 6-8.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tamale Pie is one of those quintessential American pot-luck casserole dishes. It was probably invented by someone who had a taste of a real tamale and tried to recreate the flavor in a cornbread casserole. I always loved tamale pie as a kid, fortunately it was often served in our school cafeteria. The tamale pie I remember was made with ground beef, with green chile, olives, whole corn, and topped with cornbread, though one could just as easily used pulled pork or a more traditional tamale stuffing for the casserole. Tamale pie is not remotely Mexican and only somewhat resembles the flavor of real tamales. But it does taste great, is budget friendly, and easily feeds a lot of people.\n
759	Croque Monsieur Ham and Cheese Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n2 Make the béchamel sauce. Melt butter in a small saucepan on medium/low heat until it just starts to bubble. Add the flour and cook, stirring until smooth, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk, whisking continuously, cooking until thick. Remove from heat. Add the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in the Parmesan and 1/4 cup of the grated Gruyère. Set aside.\n3 Lay out the bread slices on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven, a few minutes each side, until lightly toasted. For extra flavor you can spread some butter on the bread slices before you toast them if you want.\n(Alternatively, you can assemble the sandwiches as follows in step four and grill them on a skillet, finishing them in the broiler with the bechamel sauce.)\n4 Lightly brush half of the toasted slices with mustard. Add the ham slices and about 1 cup of the remaining Gruyère cheese. Top with the other toasted bread slices.\n5 Spoon on the béchamel sauce to the tops of the sandwiches. Sprinkle with the remaining Gruyère cheese. Place on a broiling pan. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, then turn on the broiler and broil for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, until the cheese topping is bubbly and lightly browned.\nIf you top this sandwich with a fried egg it becomes a Croque Madame.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Years ago, a French friend of mine introduced me to Croque-Monsieur, the French version of a toasted ham and Swiss sandwich. I remember it being loaded with butter and cheese, and absolutely the most delicious sandwich in the world. My friend was somewhat addicted to these sandwiches, and after having one myself I could see why. Gruyère cheese and ham just belong together. According to About.com the word croque comes from the verb croquer or “to crunch”. So a Croque-Monsieur roughly translates to “Mister Crunchy”. The feminine version, a “Croque Madam”, includes a fried egg on top. This classic French bistro sandwich is a great way to use up leftover ham.\n
760	Triple-Layer White Cake with Orange Curd Filling	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrange Curd\n\n1 Place lemon juice in small bowl or custard cup. Sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 15 minutes.\n\n2 Whisk sugar, orange juice, yolks, orange peel, and lemon peel in heavy large saucepan to blend. Add butter. Whisk over medium heat until curd thickens and bubbles begin to appear at edges, about 9 minutes. Remove from heat. Add gelatin mixture. Whisk until gelatin dissolves. Transfer curd to small bowl. Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd. Chill overnight.\n\nCake \n\n1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Sift the flour, 1 1/4 cups sugar, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl. \n\n2 Whisk the oil and egg yolks in large bowl until well blended. Whisk in the sour cream, then the milk, orange peel, and vanilla. Whisk in the dry ingredients in 3 additions. \n\n3 Using electric mixer, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 2/3 cup sugar, while beating on hight speed until you have stiff peaks.  \n\n4 Gently fold the egg whites into the batter in 4 additions.  (Do not overmix!)\n\n5 Divide batter among prepared pans.  Bake cakes until the center is just golden, a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, and the cake pulls away very slightly from pan, about 20 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans 5 minutes. Cut around pan sides. Turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely. \n\n6 Place one cake layer, flat side up, on 8-inch tart pan bottom or platter. Spread 1 cup of the orange curd over the cake. Top with the second cake layer, flat side down. Spread 1 cup of the curd over the layer. Top with the third cake layer, flat side down.  Cover and refrigerate the assembled cake.\n\nFrosting\n\n1 Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in medium bowl until smooth. Beat in powdered sugar, then 3/4 cup orange curd. \n\n2 Spread frosting over cake. (Can be made a day ahead. Cover with cake dome; refrigerate.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father has always been the baker in the family. (Mom claims she baked plenty of cakes for us growing up, but since it has been more than 20 years since we all left home, none of us remember and we just have to take her word for it.) Family gatherings such as the one we just had this Easter weekend are the perfect excuse for dad to do his thing, bake some over-the-top, takes-days-to-make, several-trips-to-the-store-for-forgotten-ingredients wondrous dessert. This triple-layer white cake with an orange curd filling is one of his favorite recipes (from Bon Appétit). It’s a little dense, but really good. You have to make the orange curd a day ahead of time, so factor that into your planning if you try it out.\n
761	Deviled Eggs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 First hard boil the eggs. (See how to make hard boiled eggs.) Fill up a large saucepan half-way with water and gently add the eggs. Cover the eggs with at least an inch of water. Add a teaspoon of vinegar to the water (this will help contain egg whites from leaking out if any of the shells crack while cooking). Add a pinch of salt to the water. Bring the water to a boil. Cover, and remove from heat. Let sit covered for 12-15 minutes. Drain hot water from pan and run cold water over the eggs. (At this point if you crack the egg shells while the eggs are cooling, it will make it easier to peel the shells.) Let sit in the cool water a few minutes, changing the water if necessary to keep it cool.\n2 Peel the eggs. Using a sharp knife, slice each egg in half, lengthwise. Gently remove the yolk halves and place in a small mixing bowl. Arrange the egg white halves on a serving platter.\n\n3 Using a fork, mash up the yolks and add mustard, mayonnaise, onion, tabasco, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Spoon egg yolk mixture into the egg white halves. Sprinkle with paprika.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Deviled eggs. Easter egg hunts and summer picnic potlucks. I have been known to devour a dozen of these in one sitting. These were quick and easy. If you want them to be a little prettier, put the egg filling into a freezer bag, make a cut off of one corner of the bag, and pipe them into the egg white halves.\nWhat follows is a basic recipe, though there are so many wonderful variations you can make. See the comments for some great ideas submitted by Simply Recipes readers. Do you have a favorite deviled egg recipe? If so, please add yours in the comments.\n
762	Ham and Asparagus Quiche	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 10-by-1 1/2-inch round tart pan (with or without a removable bottom), pressing dough into corners. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°. Line pastry with parchment paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges. Fill at least two-thirds with baking weights - dried beans, rice, or aluminum pie weights. Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper and weights. Poke the bottom of the pie pan with the tongs of a fork and return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden.  (Fork holes are for any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making filling.\n\n\n\n3 Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add shallots, and cook, stirring, until translucent but not brown, about 1 minute. Add asparagus. Cook, stirring frequently, until asparagus are just cooked (al dente), slightly browned, firm, not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n4  Increase oven temperature to 375°F.  Place tart pan on a baking sheet to catch any run-off there might be (especially if you are using a pan with a removable bottom.)  Sprinkle half the cheese evenly over the bottom of the crust. Spread asparagus and ham over the cheese and then top with remaining cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, cream, and eggs. Season with fresh ground pepper. Pour over cheese. Transfer to oven, and bake until just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes before slicing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	For the Easter holiday, I thought I would adapt my mushroom quiche recipe into a Spring brunch dish, with asparagus and ham. It turned out great, my one note is to not add any salt as the ham brings enough salt to the party.\n
763	Scalloped Potatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Butter a large casserole dish with 1 1/2 Tbsp of butter.  If you use a casserole dish that is about 9x13 (bigger than the one shown) you'll have more surface area, more of the potatoes will brown, and the cooking time will be faster.\n\n\n\n2 Layer the bottom of the casserole dish with 1/3 of the potato slices.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Layer on 1/2 of the sliced onions and 1/2 cup of the Swiss cheese. Layer on 1/2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the parsley and chives.  Sprinkle with a little Parmesan.\n\n\n\nRepeat by layering on 1/3 of the potato slices, sprinkle again with salt and pepper.  Layer on the remaining sliced onions, 1/2 cup of the Swiss cheese, the remaining bacon, parsley and chives. Sprinkle with a little Parmesan.\n\nTop the casserole with the remaining potato slices. Add the half and half.  Dot the potatoes with the remaining 1 1/2 Tbsp of butter.\n\n3 Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for one hour.  After an hour, remove from the oven, remove the foil, sprinkle on the remaining Swiss and Parmesan cheese.  Return to the oven for an additional 30-40 minutes.  When done, the potatoes should be tender, but not mushy, and the liquid should be mostly absorbed.\n\nFor a faster cooking time, you can parboil the sliced potatoes for 8 minutes first, patting them dry, before layering them in the casserole pan.  In this case the total oven cooking time is about 35-45 minutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There are many ways to make delicious scalloped potatoes. For this version, I consulted several books – Kitchen Sense, two James Beards, and theJoy of Cooking. Basically you layer thinly sliced potatoes with any number of extras – cheese, onions, parsley – add milk or cream, and bake. The potatoes absorb the liquid as they cook, the cheese melts, the top gets browned. One tip – use a shallow casserole dish. The one I used here ended up stacking the potatoes a little too high and I had to add a half hour or so to the cooking time. What you don’t want is crispy browned on top and not-cooked-enough potatoes inside. If you need a faster cooking time, Joy of Cooking recommends parboiling the potatoes first for a few minutes.\n
764	Coffee Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the milk, sugar, whole coffee beans, salt, and 1/2 cup of the cream in a medium saucepan until it is quite warm and steamy, but not boiling.  Once the mixture is warm, cover, remove from the heat, and let steep at room temperature for 1 hour.\n\n2 Pour the remaining 1 cup of cream into a medium size metal bowl, set on ice over a larger bowl.  Set a mesh strainer on top of the bowls.  Set aside.\n\n3  Reheat the milk and coffee mixture, on medium heat, until again hot and steamy (not boiling!).  In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks together.  Slowly pour the heated milk and coffee mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm milk, but not cooked by it.  Scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.\n\n4 Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof, flat-bottomed spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run.  This can take about 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n5 Pour the custard through the strainer and stir it into the cream.  Press on the coffee beans in the strainer to extract as much of the coffee flavor as possible.  Then discard the beans.  Mix in the vanilla and finely ground coffee, and stir until cool.\n\n\n\n6 Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nMakes one quart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I love coffee ice cream, but rarely get it because the caffeine does a number on me. If I have coffee or even mocha ice cream after dinner I’m jittery until 3 am. So, when I opened David Lebovitz‘s new book, The Perfect Scoop and found a recipe for coffee ice cream on page 34, the ice cream maker bowl immediately went into the freezer. If you make your own coffee ice cream, you can make it with decaffeinated beans! No late night jitters. Safe for kids. David has provided helpful advice for me on practically every ice cream recipe on this site, which have all turned out great, so it’s no wonder that his new book’s recipes are spot on. I think this is the best coffee ice cream I’ve ever had. \n
765	Ultra-Thin-Crust Pizza with Onions, Mushrooms, and Ricotta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1a If you are using a baking stone, place the stone on top of the middle rack in the oven.  Preheat the oven to 450°F.  Allow the oven to stay at 450°F for at least 15 minutes before cooking, to thoroughly heat up the stone.\n\n1b If you are NOT using a baking stone, place racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F.\n\n2 Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a small sauté pan on medium hight heat.  Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften.  Add a pinch of sugar and the balsamic vinegar, cook for a few more minutes until the onions are thoroughly softened and translucent.  Remove from heat.\n\n3a If you are using a baking stone, sprinkle some corn meal on your pizza peel and place one tortilla on top of the pizza peel.  (If you don't have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet.)  Thoroughly brush the top of the tortilla with olive oil. \n\n3b If you are not using a baking stone, line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and brush with olive oil.   Place a tortilla on each baking sheet and brush each with olive oil.\n\n4 Sprinkle each tortilla with half a cup of shredded Asiago cheese.  Add bits of ricotta cheese, 1/3 cup for each tortilla.  Sprinkle with mushrooms and with the slightly caramelized onions.  Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.\n\n5a If you are using a baking stone, and can fit both pizzas on the stone (it depends on the size of your tortilla) do it.  Use the pizza peel to transfer the pizzas to the stone in the oven.  If your tortillas are large, you'll need to cook them one at a time.  But that's okay.  Cooking on the stone goes very quickly.  Bake the pizzas until the crust is crisp and very brown - 5-7 minutes using the baking stone.  Cut with a pizza cutter or a knife.\n\n5b If you are using baking sheets, place the baking sheets in the oven.  Bake until the crust is crisp and brown all over (the time varies, depending on the oven and if your cookie sheet has already been heated, start with 10 minutes and check), rotating the sheets to ensure even baking.  Cut with a pizza cutter or a knife.\n\nEach pizza serves 1-2, depending on how hungry you are.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When I first encountered a recipe for a thin-crust pizza using a flour tortilla as a base I was indignant. “That’s not a pizza! That’s a quesadilla!” But I soon got over my ire. This approach is actually rather brilliant, a great example of borrowing from one cuisine to expand another. The recipe for this thin-crust pizza is inspired by one I found in Everyday Food magazine. The trick is to keep the toppings thin and light, otherwise the crust will end up being soggy. It really helps to use a pizza stone; the pizza will cook up faster and crisper. I’ve included directions for both using a stone and not.\n
767	Cheesy Crustless Quiche	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Melt the butter in a medium saucepan on medium heat. Stir in flour; cook, stirring until bubbly. Gradually add the milk; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens. Remove from the heat; set aside to cool, about 15-20 minutes. \n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Combine cottage cheese, baking powder, salt  and mustard; set aside. \n\n\n\n3 Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Slowly add the cream cheese, the cottage cheese mixture and the milk/flour sauce.  Fold in the Swiss and Parmesan cheeses.  \n\n4 Pour into a buttered 10" pie plate. Sprinkle the top with chopped green onions and crumbled bacon.  Arrange tomato halves, cut side up, around the top. Bake  at 350°F for 40 minutes, until puffy and lightly browned. A knife inserted into the center of the quiche should come out clean.  Let rest for 15 minutes, serve. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I had this crustless quiche recently at a ladies weekend (you know, the kind where husbands and kids are left to fend on their own and the gals take a well deserved break from the regular chaos) and couldn’t wait to try it when I got home. It is pretty rich. In my trial run I substituted some (gasp!) low fat version of cream cheese, and was promptly reminded by my mother that they make up for the fat with carb-loaded filler. I also just used my substitutions as an excuse to eat more. So now I’m sticking with the original full octane approach. Before putting the quiche in the oven I sprinkled it with green onions, bacon, and cherry tomatoes. This is a pretty flexible recipe, you can add whatever additions you want – herbs, mushrooms (dry sauté them first to get out the excess moisture), sausage, etc. Thanks to Cindy for this great recipe!\n
768	Make Your Own Juice Popsicles	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 1 cup of water and 3/4 to 1 cup of granulated sugar in a small saucepan until the sugar has completely dissolved. Add the zest of 2 lemons and 1 Tbsp of light corn syrup into the sugar water (also called simple syrup). Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat and let cool.\n2 Juice enough lemons (about 4) to produce 1 cup of lemon juice. Strain out any pulp. Add the simple syrup to the lemon juice, straining out the lemon zest as you pour the syrup into the juice.\n3 Pour the lemon mixture into the popsicle molds. Put into a freezer for at least 4 hours to freeze. To unmold, run under hot water for a few seconds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Is there nothing better than an ice-cold popsicle on a sweltering summer day? No need to wait for the icecream man’s truck to make a pass through your neighborhood. It is easy to make your own popsicles. Do you make popsicles at home? How do you make your favorites?\n\nI bought the rocket molds for these popsicles years ago. Similar molds are available through Amazon.com by Tovolo. The Tovolo molds come with a snap-in base to hold them upright in the freezer. The molds easily come off of the popsicle after you run them under warm water for a few seconds. The handle doubles as a “drip pan” to catch the juice as it melts. A potential problem is that the molds may stand too high for some people’s freezer compartments. But the upside is that you can easily remove one popsicle at a time.\nThere are other molds available on the market, some with built-in reusable plastic sticks, some using wooden sticks. An ebay or Google search for “popsicle mold” will turn up many options. In addition to the popsicle molds by Tovolo I found similar sets of popsicle molds for sale.\n
769	Grilled Chicken with Tomato Tarragon Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Get the grill started on medium high heat. While the grill is heating up, whisk together half of the tarragon, half of the oil, and all but 1/4 teaspoon of the minced garlic in a shallow dish.\n2 With a rolling pin or meat pounder, pound the chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper until they are an even 1/2-inch thickness. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the tarragon mixture and toss to coat with the mixture. Let sit at room temp for 10 to 15 minutes.\n3 While the chicken is marinating, use a blender or food processor to purée the tomato and remaining olive oil into a smooth sauce. Add the vinegar and remaining tarragon and garlic and pulse until well blended. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n4 Grill the chicken breasts until nicely browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.\nServe with tomato tarragon sauce.\nSlightly adapted from a recipe in Bon Appetit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Heidi H prepared this grilled chicken dish for me last month when I was visiting her and family in Massachusetts. It was absolutely delicious and I couldn’t wait to try it at home on our grill. The recipe calls for skin-on which we all loved, but you could easily use skinless if you wanted. My father suggests using basil instead of tarragon for another twist on this recipe.\n
770	Rhubarb Berry Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Roll out one ball of pie dough on a lightly floured surface to 12-inch diameter.  Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with the dough. Chill in refrigerator while you prepare the fruit.\n\n2 Stir sugar and quick cooking tapioca pearls together in a large bowl.  Add the rhubarb, strawberries, and other berries.  Add the lemon juice, vanilla, and mace or nutmeg.  Stir gently to coat berries with the sugar.  Let sit for 15 minutes, stirring once.  Preheat oven to 375°F.\n\n3 Roll out second ball of pie dough.  If you plan to do a lattice top, as pictured, prepare the dough strips as described in How to Make a Lattice Top for a Pie Crust.  \n\n4 Scoop fruit mixture into dough-lined pie dish. \n\n5 If you would like a lattice top, weave strips of pie dough over the top of the fruit-filled pie dish as described in How to Make a Lattice Top for a Pie Crust.  (If you would like a solid top for your pie, place the second rolled-out pie dough crust on top of the pie.)  Press ends of strips into the rim of the bottom crust.  Trim the edges to 1/2-inch.  Fold the edges back over themselves and crimp to seal.  If you are using a solid top crust, score the top to create air vents.\n\n6 To protect the crust edges from burning, cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or an aluminum pie protector.  Bake in the middle rack for 25 minutes.  Remove the foil.  Return to oven and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, until the top is golden and the juices are bubbling.  Cool completely before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The first time we made this pie we used blueberries instead of blackberries and a whole cup of sugar instead a half. The blueberries were frozen and not completely thawed or drained. The pie ended up being runny (pie soup anyone?), the blueberries dominated the flavor (they were all you could taste), and the pie was way too sweet. Well, my mother liked it, but she likes things super sweet. My father and I love the tartness of rhubarb and want to taste it. So naturally, as soon as that pie was half eaten, we made plans to make another one. This time we used marionberry blackberries, frozen from last season, along with fresh rhubarb and strawberries. We cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup (a little tart, could have used another tablespoon or two) and remembered to defrost and drain the marionberries. Perfect! (Don’t you love fruit pie season?)\n
982	Chicken Enchiladas Verdes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put chicken thighs in a medium sized saucepan and just cover with water.  Add one clove of garlic that has been cut in half, 1/4 of an onion, and 1 teaspoon of salt to the water.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a low simmer, and cook, covered, for 20 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked through.  Remove chicken thighs to a separate bowl and let cool enough to touch.\n\n \n\n2 While the chicken is cooking, put the tomatillos and 3 serrano chile peppers in a separate sauce pan and cover them with water.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer.  Simmer until the tomatillos are cooked, and have changed color, but are not mushy, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer tomatillos and serranos to a blender.  Add 1/2 cup of the tomatillo cooking liquid to the blender, as well as 2 cloves of garlic, a third a cup of your chopped onion, and about 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro (packed).  (Remaining chopped onion and cilantro will be used for garnish.)  Add one teaspoon of salt.  Purée until completely blended, 15 to 30 seconds.  Taste for heat.  If not spicy enough add another chile pepper (doesn't have to be cooked).  Note that sour cream will eventually be added to the sauce which will cool down a lot of the spiciness.  Add more salt to taste if necessary.  Pour sauce into a skillet, bring to a simmer and let simmer for 5 minutes. Then remove from heat.\n\n3 Remove the cooked chicken meat from the bones.  Shred the meat with a fork or knife.  Put the chicken in a bowl and add 1/3 to a 1/2 cup of the tomatillo sauce to the chicken.  Taste the chicken; if it needs salt, add a little.\n\n\n\n4 Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on medium high heat.  Add a tortilla to the pan and use a metal spatula to flip it to the other side.  Place another tortilla on top of this one (to soak up the excess oil) and flip again.  When the tortillas are heated through, remove them to a plate lined with paper towel.  Add a little more oil to the pan, and add another couple tortillas.  Continue to heat through and soften all of the tortillas.  Note that if you are using just made homemade tortillas you can skip this step because the tortillas are already hot, softened, and ready to eat.\n\n \n\n4 Warm the oven to 200°F.  Dip a tortilla in the salsa verde tomatillo sauce and place it on an oven-proof serving dish.  Scoop a spoonful of chicken into the center of the tortilla and roll up the tortilla. Place on the serving dish and repeat with all of the tortillas.  Put into the warm oven to keep the enchiladas warm while you finish the sauce.\n\n5 Heat the salsa verde sauce again until simmering, then remove from heat.  Stir in the sour cream until well blended.  Remove the warming enchiladas from the oven and pour salsa verde sauce over all of them.  Top with chopped onion, cheese, and cilantro. \n\nServe immediately.  Serve with extra garnishes of onion, cheese, and cilantro on the side.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The tomatillos in my garden are all ripening at once. Have you ever cooked with tomatillos? They look like little lanterns, with their green papery husks. Sometimes people mistake them for green tomatoes (doesn’t help that their Spanish name is “tomate verde”); they are related to tomatoes (same family, different genus), but the taste is quite different. They are used to make the distinctive Mexican salsa verde or green salsa. In this chicken enchiladas recipe, the sauce is made with boiled tomatillos (you could also roast them), serrano chile peppers, and sour cream. The filling is made with shredded meat from chicken thighs; the deeper flavor of the dark meat holds up much better to the chile and tomatillo sauce than chicken breasts. I made these for dinner tonight and even the kid, my young nephew, went for seconds. Not a smidgen of sauce was left on any of our plates.\n
771	Chicken Curry in a Hurry	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Cut the chicken breast cutlets in half or into thirds or quarters to make smaller serving pieces (they'll cook more quickly too). Sprinkle them on both sides lightly with salt (about 1/4 teaspoon). Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the curry powder, lightly rubbing the curry powder into the chicken on all sides.\n\n2 Heat the oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onions. Cook until translucent, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper while the onions are cooking. Drain the raisins from the water and add them to the onions. Lower the heat to medium and sprinkle the onions with the remaining 2 teaspoons of curry powder. Continue to cook for another minute or two.\n\n3 Push the onions to one side of the skillet. Place the chicken pieces in the pan in a single layer. Cook 2-3 minutes on each side, until lightly browned and just cooked through. Remove the chicken pieces to a plate. (Bunch them together so they retain their heat.)\n\n4 Add the sour cream and/or yogurt mixture and stir over medium-low heat until the mixture has heated through. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little water to thin it. If you are using yogurt, or low-fat sour cream, be careful not to let the mixture simmer or it may curdle! Return the chicken to the skillet (and any juices from the plate the chicken has been resting on), turn over the pieces in the sauce. When all is heated through, it's ready to serve.\nGarnish with cilantro and toasted slivered almonds and serve alone or over rice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated May 27, 2014\nWe first encountered “Chicken Curry in a Hurry” in Mark Bittman’s Quick and Easy Recipes from the New York Times. The concept is simple. You’re looking for maximum flavor in minimal time. We’ve made a few small changes to Mark’s original recipe—cutting the chicken into easier to cook pieces, salting the chicken first to intensify its flavor, plumping the raisins, and doubling the amount of curry powder. It’s an easy curry dish, with lots of flavor, that can be made in about 30 minutes!\n
773	Tuscan Meatloaf with Mushroom Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Soak the mushrooms in two cups of lukewarm water for half an hour or more.  \n\n2 In a bowl, break up the beef with a fork.  In a small bowl, combine the milk and bread, and mash until creamy.  Add the milk and bread to the meat, along with the onion, salt, pepper, prosciutto, cheese, and garlic.  Mix thoroughly by hand.  Mix in the lightly beaten egg yolk.  Shape meat into a firm, round ball; then roll this into a salami-like loaf about two and a half inches thick.  Tap with your palm to drive out any air bubbles. Roll the loaf in the bread crumbs until evenly coated.  \n\n3 Drain the mushrooms (reserving the soaking water) and rinse them several times in clean, cold water.  Chop the mushrooms roughly and set aside. Strain the soaking water through a fine sieve lined with paper towels.  Whisk in the tomato paste and set aside.\n\n4 Heat the butter and vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or heavy casserole pan just big enough for the meat.  Brown the meat on all sides in the pan over medium heat after the butter foam subsides.  Add the wine.  Increase heat to medium high.  Boil wine briskly until reduced one half, turning meat carefully once or twice.  Turn heat to medium low and add chopped mushrooms.  Add the tomato paste mushroom water to the meat and mushrooms.  Cover and cook at a simmer for 30 minutes, turning the meat once or twice.  \n\n5 Carefully remove meat to a cutting board.  Allow it to cool slightly and settle.  Cut into slanted slices about 3/8 of an inch thick.  If the sauce seems thin, concentrate it by boiling rapidly for a few minutes.  Pour a little sauce on a warm serving platter, arrange the meat slices, then cover the remainder of the sauce.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father pulled this Tuscan meat loaf recipe from the New York Times magazine a few months ago and we gave it a try the other night. It was excellent, as tasty as a meatloaf can be. It does however produce twice as much sauce as one can reasonably use with the meatloaf. We had ours the next day with pasta. One of the things I like about this recipe is that it is made entirely on the stove top. Most meat loaf recipes are made in the oven, but as the warmer months approach it’s nice to have a stovetop alternative.\n
774	Shortbread Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine flour, salt, butter, and sugar in a bowl.  Mix with your fingers until it forms flaky crumbs and lumps.  Mix in the egg, almond extract, and lemon juice.  Continue to mix until it clumps; at first it may seem very dry.  Shape into two balls, flatten into disks, wrap in plastic, refrigerate at least an hour, preferably overnight.\n\n2 Pre-heat oven to 350°F.\n\n\n\n3 Let the dough sit at temperature for at least 10-15 minutes before attempting to work with it.  The dough may be crumbly; if it falls apart, press it back together.  Allow to relax enough to become somewhat pliable before rolling out.  Roll out a disk, one at a time, between two sheets of parchment paper (or wax paper), to a 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness, depending on how thick or thin you would like your cookies to be.\n\n\n\n4 Dip the edges of one side of your cookie cutter into flour and cut out your cookie shapes.  If the rolled-out dough becomes too soft to work with, place it in the freezer for a few minutes to firm up.  Place on parchment paper or Silpat on a cookie sheet, with at least 1/2-inch distance between the cookie shapes.\n\n5 Bake at 350°F for 8-12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the cookies, until the edges are just slightly golden brown.  Remove from oven.  Let cool on a rack for 10 minutes.\n\nMakes 3-5 dozen cookies, depending on how thick, and the size of your cookie cutters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	More photos\nSeveral months ago we attempted a New York Times recipe for a lemon confit shortbread tart. Like fellow food-blogger Deb, we had a miserable experience with the recipe. It was just too tart to eat. However, I had some extra dough from making the pie crust and decided to roll it out, cut some cookies, and see how they were. I rolled the cookies out pretty thin, much thinner than what is more typical of shortbread, and pulled them out of the oven just as their edges started to brown. They were so light, they practically melted on the tongue. My parents insisted that I make another batch the next day. I made several dozen. All of the cookies were devoured within 36 hours and I was not permitted to give any of them away to friends. If you are looking for something nice to make for your mom for Mother’s Day, these cookies may just be the thing.\n
775	Strawberry Milk	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPut milk, strawberries, and 1 Tbsp of honey into a blender. Blend until thoroughly smooth. Taste and add more honey if you wish your strawberry milk to be a little sweeter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I bought my goddaughter Piper and her sisters the Green Eggs and Ham Cookbook for Christmas this year and the one recipe Piper (age 4) wanted to make was the “Pink Yink Ink Drink”. The Yink drink calls for frozen blackberries (which we didn’t have) and fresh strawberries (which we did), so we made strawberry milk, which suited the Pipe just fine.\n
776	Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Orange Marmalade Glaze	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a small saucepan, bring the soy sauce, marmalade, honey, rice wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes to a simmer over medium heat.  Remove from the flame and let cool to room temperature.  Distribute the glaze evenly in 2 bowls.  Marinate the tenderloin roast for a min of 1 hour in the glaze.\n\n2 Heat the grill to 350°F or medium.  Put on the tenderloin.  Grill 8 minutes on one side (check at 6 minutes), depending on size of pork loin.  Then flip it, baste it.  Grill another 6-10 minutes.  Start checking with a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, at about 6 minutes on the second side.  Cook until internal temperature reaches 140°F.  Remove from heat.\n\n3 If you have let the temp get above 140°F, you may need to slice the pork immediately or the meat will continue to cook as it rests and become overcooked.  If you have taken it out in time, let the pork rest 10 minutes.  Thinly slice, sprinkle with the remaining glaze and scallions.\n\nServe with rice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The secret to grilling pork tenderloin, as I learned from my friend Vaughn, is to watch it carefully, with a meat thermometer in hand, because “once it goes, it goes quickly.” A pork tenderloin is a long, narrow cut of meat which cooks very quickly, so that the difference between perfectly done and over-cooked is slim, time-wise. Have a meat thermometer ready, and start checking with increasing frequency as you approach the expected cooking time.\n
778	Carne Asada	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Lay the flank steak in a large non-reactive bowl or baking dish.  Combine marinade ingredients and pour the marinade over the steak.  Make sure each piece is well coated.  Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-4 hours.  \n\n\n\n2 Preheat your grill over  medium-high flame (you can also use a cast iron grill pan on high heat for stove-top cooking).  Brush the grates with a little oil to prevent the meat from sticking.  Remove the steak from the marinade.  If you are cooking indoors, you may want to brush off excess marinade as the bits may burn and smoke on the hot pan.  Season both sides of the steak pieces with salt and pepper.  Grill the pieces for a few minutes only, on each side, depending on how thin they are, until medium rare to well done, to your preference.  You may need to work in batches.  Remove the steak pieces to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.  Thinly slice the steak across the grain on a diagonal.\n\n(Optional) Serve with warm tortillas (flour or corn).  Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill, until toasty and pliable.  Alternatively, you can warm tortillas in a microwave:  heating just one or two at a time, place tortillas on a paper towel and microwave them for 15 to 20 seconds each on high.\n\n(Optional) Serve with pico de gallo (fresh tomato salsa) and chopped avocados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Carne asada shown wrapped up in a flour tortilla with pico de gallo and avocado\nCarne asada is the thinly sliced, grilled beef served so often in tacos and burritos. It is also commonly served as is, with rice and beans on the side. Although almost any cut of beef can be butterflied into thin sheets for the carne asada, typically it is made from flank steak or skirt steak. It can be grilled just with salt and pepper for flavorings, or it can be marinated. The following is a recipe for marinated carne asada.\n
779	Chickpea Potato Curry	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large pot, heat the butter over medium-high heat and sauté the onions and ginger until the onion begins to brown, about 4-5 minutes. Add the salt, cumin, coriander and cayenne, stir to combine and cook for another minute or two.\n\n2 Add the remaining ingredients, stir to mix and simmer vigorously for about 35 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.  Add more salt to taste.  \n\nServe the curry in bowls over rice.  Great accompanied with plain yogurt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This is one of those pull-together-at-the-last-minute-from-the-pantry meals that is surprisingly good. Spicy, filling, and doesn’t break the bank. The recipe is only slightly adapted from a recipe by my friend Ann Martin Rolke, who, with a young child underfoot, is always looking for easy-to-make nutritional meals that taste great. Enjoy!\n
780	Grilled Corn-on-the-Cob	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Prepare your grill, gas or charcoal, with direct, high heat, about 550°F.\n2 Place the corn in their husks on the hot grill. Cover. Turn the corn occasionally, until the husks are charred on all sides, about 15 to 20 minutes.\n3 Remove corn from grill. Let sit for 5 minutes. Use a hand towel to protect your hands while removing the silks and charred husks from the corn.\nServe hot, with butter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The first time I tried grilling corn-on-the-cob, by placing shucked corn directly on the grill, the results weren’t all that stellar. Too dried out and chewy. I consulted “She-who-knows-everything-when-it-comes-to-home-cooking” (a.k.a. mom) who informed me that the best way to grill corn is to cook the corn in their husks, directly on a hot grill. The husks protect the corn from getting dried out and the corn essentially steams in its own moisture. If you are working with fresh corn, there really is no need to soak the corn in water first as called for by some. The smokey corn husks impart a wonderful flavor to the corn as well.\n
781	Heath Bar Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHeath Bars are popular American chocolate-covered-toffee candy bars.  Heath Bar toffee bits are often available in the baking section of grocery stores.  Either chopped up candy bars or the bits can be used for this recipe.  The bars have chocolate, the bits don't.\n\n1 Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda.  Set aside.  In a separate bowl, combine Heath Bar pieces and chopped walnuts.  Set aside.\n\n2 Beat together the butter and sugar.  Beat in eggs one at a time, and vanilla.\n\n3 Alternatively mix in the Heath Bar mixture and the flour mixture, a third at a time, until well blended.  Chill cookie dough for at least 30 minutes (better an hour or longer).\n\n4 Preheat oven to 350°F.  On cookie sheets lined with parchment paper or Silpat, spoon out the cookie dough in small 1-inch diameter balls (size of a large marble).  Place dough balls 3 inches away from each other on the cookie sheets. (Make sure there is plenty of room between the cookie balls, and that the cookie balls aren't too big.  These cookies spread!)\n\n\n\n5 Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are just starting to brown.  Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes.  Then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nMakes about 6 dozen cookies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“OMG, these are the best cookies I’ve ever eaten in my life,” I mumbled to mom the other day, mouth full of cookie, one hand reaching for another. “Would you please get the recipe from Claire? Puhleeezzzz?” Claire is my mother’s friend, a lovely woman in her 80s, recently widowed, who brought my mom these fabulous cookies for a book club gathering. I couldn’t figure out what was in them that made them taste so good. I recognized some chocolate and a few nuts, but what was the rest? Praise be to mom who delivered Claire’s recipe a few days later. Heath Bars. The secret ingredient was Heath Bars. Well no wonder! If you like toffee as much as I do, you’ll love these cookies.\n
782	Cilantro Lime Herb Butter	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMix together butter, cilantro, lime juice, and salt in a small bowl.  Serve as is or save for later.\n\nIf you save the butter for later, wrap it up in plastic wrap in the shape of a log and refrigerate until stiff.  To use, just unwrap and slice from the butter log.\n\nServe with corn-on-the-cob or over your favorite fill-in-the-blank.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	An herbed butter is a great way to dress up corn-on-the-cob, veggies of all kinds, chicken, fish, prawns, pork, steak, you name it. Here’s an herb butter recipe, Southwestern style, with cilantro and lime. Do you ever make herbed butters? If so, what’s your favorite combo?\n
783	Easy Black Beans and Rice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook rice according to package instructions. White rice usually takes 15 minutes to cook once the water is simmering, and 10 minutes to sit.\n2 Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high. Sauté onions and bell peppers for 3-4 minutes, until just beginning to soften, then add garlic and sauté a minute more. Add the black beans, vinegar and Tabasco or cayenne. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3 Stir in rice and oregano. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Black beans and rice is such a classic combination, especially in Caribbean or Southern cooking. There are probably dozens of ways to make it; this one is an easy recipe that cooks up quick and tastes great. Now, if you are really serious about your beans you’ll soak dry black beans overnight and then cook them for an hour or two first, but then that wouldn’t be quick and easy. So we’ll save that approach for another recipe. This recipe is better for a “the chicken is on the grill, what am I going to serve it with?” side dish, and uses canned black beans. By the way, my pal David recommends mixing some chopped up canned green olives, the ones with pimentos in them, for giving an additional boost to basic black beans and rice.\n
784	Jerk Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put vinegar, rum, hot peppers, onion, green onion tops, thyme, olive oil, salt, pepper, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and molasses into a blender.  Pulse until mostly smooth.  \n\n\n\n2 Place chicken in a large freezer bag, or in a large roasting pan or baking dish.  Pour lime juice over the chicken and coat well.  Add the jerk paste to the chicken pieces and coat well.  Seal the bag or cover the chicken in the pan with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate overnight.\n\n3 When you are ready to cook the chicken, remove chicken from the marinade bag or pan.  Put the remaining marinade into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.  Set aside to use as a basting sauce for the chicken.  If you want you can reserve a little of the marinade (once boiled for 10 minutes since it has been in contact with raw chicken) to serve with the chicken or to mix with some ketchup and a dash of soy sauce for a serving sauce.\n\n\n\n4a Grilling Method \nPreheat grill to medium high.  Sprinkle chicken halves with salt and pepper. Place chicken halves, skin side down on the grill grates.  Cover.  Cook for approximately one hour, keeping the internal grill temperature between 350°F and 400°F, turning the chickens occasionally and basting with marinade, until the chicken halves are cooked through.  The chicken is done when the juices run clear (not pink) when a knife tip is inserted into both the chicken breast and thigh, about 165-170°F for the breast and 180-185°F for the thigh. Transfer chicken to platter. Tent loosely with foil to keep warm and let stand 15 minutes.\n\n4b Oven Method\nPreheat oven to 350°F.  Place chicken halves in a rimmed baking pan, skin side up.  Roast until chicken halves are cooked through, about 50-60 minutes.  The chicken is done when the juices run clear (not pink) when a knife tip is inserted into both the chicken breast and thigh, about 165-170°F for the breast and 180-185°F for the thigh. Transfer chicken to platter. Tent loosely with foil to keep warm and let stand 15 minutes.\n\nCut chicken into pieces.  Serve with black beans and rice.\n\nServes 6 to 8.\n\nRecipe adapted from several sources, including Bon Appetit magazine. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I recently had the jerk chicken at a local Davis hangout, the psychedelically inspired Delta of Venus. The place looks a bit scruffy, but my oh my is their jerk chicken good. And hot. My meal there led me to do some research on jerk preparations. Jerk seasoning, if you are unfamiliar with it, is based on two main ingredients – Scotch Bonnet chili peppers (or habaneros) and allspice, and is how they like to cook chicken in Jamaica and throughout the Caribbean. The following recipe we cooked up isn’t as scorching as the Delta of Venus’, but it is still plenty spicy, and great the next day in a chicken salad. Serve with rice (to spread out the heat) and a very large glass of cold beer. Do you have a favorite jerk seasoning recipe? Please let us know about it in the comments.\n
787	How to Prepare Horseradish	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 If you have access to a garden horseradish plant, use a sturdy shovel to dig up an 8-10-inch long tuber of horseradish.  (You can't pull it up.) The plant itself, once established, propagates with tubers, and is very hardy.  (See Wikipedia on horseradish).  Remove the leaves from the root and rinse the dirt off of the root.\n\n\n\n2 Use a vegetable peeler to peel the surface skin off of the tuber.  Chop into pieces.\n\n\n\n3 Put into a food processor.  Add a couple tablespoons of water. Process until well ground.  At this point be careful.  A ground up fresh horseradish is many times as potent as freshly chopped onions and can really hurt your eyes if you get too close.  Keep at arms length away, and work in a well ventilated room.  Strain out some of the water if the mixture is too liquidy.  Add a tablespoon of white vinegar and a pinch of salt to the mixture.  Pulse to combine.\n\nNote that the vinegar will stabilize the level of hotness of the ground horseradish, so do not wait too long to add it to the mixture.\n\n\n\n4 Using a rubber spatula, carefully transfer the grated horseradish to a jar.  It will keep for 3 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	People either love horseradish or they hate it. One bite of pungent prepared horseradish is enough to clear out anyone’s sinuses. Hotter than the popular Japanese version of wasabi, horseradish is easy to grow and easy to prepare. If you don’t have access to a garden plant, you can often find the roots at markets such as Whole Foods. Homemade prepared horseradish is about twice as strong as store-bought versions, and lasts about 3 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.\n
788	Rustic Apricot Tart	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium bowl, mix the sugar, flour, cardamom and chipotle chile powder.  Fold in the apricot halves and raisins, until they are well coated with the mixture.  Set aside and let macerate for 10 minutes.\n\n2 If you are working with chilled pie dough, remove from the refrigerator to let stand for 10 minutes before rolling out.\n\n3 Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the pie dough to a 13-inch round of even thickness.\n\n4 If you are cooking on the grill, transfer the rolled-out pie dough to a large, lightly buttered, doubled over square of aluminum foil.  If you are baking in the oven, transfer to small-rimmed, lightly buttered baking sheet.\n\n\n\n5 Place the apricot mixture in the center of the pie dough round, leaving a border of 2 inches on all sides.  Sprinkle the top with the chopped pecans.  Fold the edges of the pie crust up and over so that a small circle of filling is visible.\n\n6a Grilling Directions.\nPrepare grill (either charcoal or gas) for indirect medium heat.  Carefully transfer the tart on foil to the grill.  Make sure it isn't directly over any coals or gas flame.  Cover the grill.  If your grill has a temperature gauge, try to keep the temp between 350°F and 400°F.  Cook for 40-50 minutes, until crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly.\n\n6b Oven Directions.\nPreheat oven to 350°F.  Cook tart for 45-50 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly.\n\nGreat served with vanilla ice cream.\n\nMakes 6 servings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Leave it to the lady with the tree to have some great recipes for apricots. My neighbor Pat (the one whose tree is raining apricots this week) suggested cooking an apricot pie on the grill and passed along a recipe. I modified it a bit, but the essence is the same. The seasoning is brown sugar, cardamom, and chipotle powder. Pat says, “Be sure to include the chipotle powder!” and she’s right. It gives it a lovely subtle kick. Have you ever baked on a grill? When the hot weather settles in we avoid using the oven; the AC is working hard enough as it is. Now that I have baked on the grill a couple of times, it’s not so hard. Just make sure that what you are baking is not directly over the coals or flame or the bottom will get burnt. Instructions for baking both on the grill and in an oven are included.\n
789	Black Bean Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large bowl, combine the beans, corn, onions, jalapeno chile peppers, tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, basil, lime juice and olive oil.  \n\n2 Add sugar and salt and pepper to taste.  (The sugar will help balance the acidity from the tomatoes and lime juice.)  Chill before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What is it about a black bean salad that practically shouts, “summer potluck”? The mercury has been edging past a hundred degrees lately here and I’ve been getting nostalgic for some of the picnic foods I remember having often as a kid. The basic structure of a black bean salad is black beans (canned or freshly made) with corn kernels (canned, frozen, or fresh). Parsley, basil or cilantro can add a bitter to the flavors. Tomatoes, lemon juice and or lime juice some acid. Jalapeno or cumin will give it a kick, and avocado and olive oil will smooth it down. I find adding a little bit of sugar almost always helps balance the acid from the citrus and tomatoes, and makes for a better tasting salad.\nObviously, this salad will be extra good if you have freshly cooked corn and beans on hand. But if you don’t, just use the canned beans and frozen corn (we used white corn here).\n
790	Sake Ginger Glazed Salmon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix the soy sauce, sake, mirin, ginger, garlic, chile flakes, and sugar in a medium bowl. Place the salmon fillets in a sturdy freezer bag. Pour the marinade into the freezer bag with the fish. Seal the freezer bag and place in a baking dish (so that if the bag leaks it doesn't get all over your fridge). Place in your refrigerator and chill at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.\n2 Remove the salmon fillets from the marinade. Place the marinade in a small saucepan and heat it until it simmers.  Simmer it for several minutes or until the sauce has reduced by half.\n3a Grilling method\nBrush the grill grates with olive oil; pre-heat your grill to medium heat. Remove salmon from bag, reserving the marinade. Place salmon either directly on the grill grate, or on a piece of aluminum foil (brushed with olive oil) over the grill grate, skin side down. Brush frequently with the marinade glaze, cook the salmon 10-20 minutes (depending on thickness of the fillets), until easily flaked with a fork.\n3b Pan frying method\nHeat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drain the salmon and reserve the marinade. Fry the salmon 4 to 5 minutes per side, basting frequently with the marinade. Serve once the salmon is cooked through and is easily flaked with a fork.\n3c Baking method\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Brush the top of the foil with olive oil. Drain the salmon and reserve the marinade. Place salmon on the foil, skin side down. Bake for 10-20 minutes depending on how thick the fillets are, basting frequently with the marinade, until the salmon is easily flaked with a fork.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My sister Karen (Austin‘s mom) is in town, flush from completing a grueling, 500 mile bike ride from San Francisco to LA. Karen has always been a super athlete, and with her current passion for triathlons takes a lot of care about how she nourishes her body. This is one of her favorite recipes for salmon, one of the best sources of Omega 3.\nThis is a very simple, highly flavorful salmon dish, using a classic Japanese yakitori marinade with the addition of some finely grated fresh ginger. The dish benefits from sitting in the marinade for a long time, overnight is best, but at least 2 hours minimum. If you don’t like the look of the ginger, you can strain it out of the basting sauce, but you’ll miss out on the flavor.\n
806	Strawberry Watermelon Agua Fresca	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPut all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. If you want, you can strain the purée through a mesh sieve, to strain out any pulpy pieces that didn't get broken up in the blender. Adjust the ingredients to taste.\nMakes 4 cups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Head into any taqueria here in the West and likely you’ll find agua fresca (translated literally “fresh water”) for sale as well. The standard flavors are tamarindo (made with tamarind), horchata (rice and cinnamon), and jamaica (hibiscus), but you can make agua fresca, a cooling, refreshing drink, from almost any juicy fruit. They were selling this combination – watermelon and strawberry – at Whole Foods today. The samples were so good I had to make some for myself when I got home. I think they would freeze well, too, as a fruit popsicle (without the added water, and maybe a bit more sugar).\n
792	Vegetarian Banana Leaf Tamales	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrepare the Masa\n\n\n\nIf you have purchased prepared masa, you can skip this step.  If you have masa harina (masa flour), add warm water to the masa harina, amount according to the instructions on the package.  Stir to incorporate.  Let sit for several minutes.  Need the dough with your hands just enough so that all of the masa flour is incorporated.\n\nPrepare the Sauce\n\nSee the instructions in this red chili sauce recipe for preparing the chili sauce with the ancho chilies.  \n\n1 Working on one chile at a time, use a paring knife to cut a slit all the way down one side of a chile. Open up the chile and remove the stem and seeds. Remove as much of the veins as you can. Reserve a few of the seeds or veins for adding later if you want added heat. Note when working with chilies, either wear protective gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling the chilies.\n\n2 Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Flatten out the dried chilies as well as you can and place on the skillet to heat. Press down on the opened chilies and leave for a few seconds. Turn the chilies over and heat a few seconds more. You do not want to toast or burn the chilies, just heat them enough to draw out more of the flavor.\n\n3 Add the chilies to a small saucepan and add enough water so that they are just covered. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes, until the chilies have softened and plumped up. (OR pour place the chilies in a small saucepan and pour boiling water over them to cover.  Let sit for 15 minutes, until softened.)\n\n4 Reserving the soaking water, remove the chilies from the pan and place in a blender. Add the garlic, salt, ground pepper, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid. Purée for 2 minutes, until the sauce is completely smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. If you want more heat, add in a few of the seeds or veins and purée some more. Add more salt if needed.\n\n5 Pour the sauce through a sieve into a skillet. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the sauce. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain the simmer, cook for 10 minutes. Skim off the foam. Remove from heat. \n\nPrepare the Banana Leaves\n\n\n\nIf you are using frozen banana leaves (available at many Asian and Mexican markets), rinse them under warm water to defrost.  Cut away the thick edges of the leaves.\n\nIf you are using fresh banana leaves, also cut away the thick edges (and central stem if you are using freshly cut leaves).  Note that you can cut off sinewy strips from the stem edge of the banana leaves to use as ties for the tamales. Rinse the leaves.\n\nBanana leaves may be brittle and tear when you try to fold them.  One way I've heard of to soften them is to soak them in warm, salted water for about an hour. Another way to soften them which I have found effective, is to hold them over heat, either over a gas burner or a hot pan for a few seconds.  Heat them only enough so that they turn color (brighter green) and soften.  If you heat them too long, they will toast and become brittle again.\n\n\n\nCut the banana leaves into rectangles about 8"x10".  Dry off with a towel.\n\nPrepare the Filling\n\n\n\n1 Coat the bottom of a very large sauté pan with 1-2 Tbsp olive oil.  Heat to high heat.  Add the onions, garlic, and carrots.  Sauté for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly. Then add the tomatoes and squash.  Sauté for a couple more minutes.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until just wilted.  Remove from heat.\n\n2 Stir in 1/2 cup of chile sauce to the vegetables.  Taste.  Add more salt if needed.\n\nAssemble the Tamales\n\nBanana leaves have two sides.  One side, the top of the leaf, is deep green and has somewhat thick ridges.  The other side, the bottom of the leaf, is lighter green and is smoother.  According to Diana Kennedy (and they guy I talked to at the local Mexican market) you will want to place the masa on the lighter green, smoother side of the leaf.  (I've done it both ways and haven't found it making that big of a difference to the taste.)\n\n1 Lay out the rectangle piece of banana leaf, light side up.  Place a 1/4 to a 1/3 of a cup of masa on the center of the banana leaf.  Press down on it with the palm of your hand to spread it out a bit.\n\n\n\n2 Place a small bit (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon) of the red chili sauce on the masa.  Place a strip of Monterey Jack cheese on top.  Scoop some of the vegetable mixture (1/4 to 1/3 cup) on top of the cheese and masa.\n\n\n\n3 Bring together the two long sides of the banana leaf and fold over, tucking one edge over the other if you can (if not, don't sweat it).  Fold the two remaining sides under the tamale.  Secure with a piece of kitchen string, or with some of the long stringy pieces that you can cut from the stem edge of the banana leaves.  You can also make ties by pulling off some long thin strips from the larger part of the banana leaf and tying them together to form a long enough strip with which to tie up a tamale.  Or, you can skip the tying step all together and just fold them well.\n\n\n\nIf upon your first attempt to wrap a tamale the banana leaf is too brittle and tears, you may need to soften the banana leaves by heating them first as mentioned earlier.\n\nSteam the Tamales\n\n1 Place a steamer rack in the bottom of a very large stockpot.  Add enough water to almost come up to the level of the steam rack, about 3/4 or 1 inch.  Line the top of the steam rack with banana leaves.  \n\n\n\n2 Carefully place the tamales in layers on the bottom of the pan.  When you have added all of the tamales, add another layer of banana leaves.  Cover the pot.  \n\n3 Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.  Steam cook for approximately one hour.\n\nMakes approximately one dozen tamales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Tamales are a Latin American favorite, a delicious filling surrounded by corn meal dough, and steamed until cooked. Most tamales that we have the occasion to eat here in the US are wrapped in corn husks, the method typical of central and Northern Mexico. In the more tropical areas of Mexico and Central America, you’ll commonly find tamales wrapped in banana leaves or plantain leaves, which have their own unique and subtle flavor.\nIf you’ve never made tamales before, it’s a pretty long and involved process, which is why the making of them is so often a social event. Several dozens are made at a time, with the help of many hands. Tamales freeze well, so it makes sense to make more than you can eat at the time. The following process for making these wonderful banana leaf tamales was taught to me over several days by my good friend Arturo, who calls them “nacatamales”. I have since made them several times for our family with great results. This recipe is for a vegetarian filling, but you could also use a pulled pork or shredded chicken filling. The recipe makes about one dozen tamales; you can easily scale up the recipe. As Arturo says, !Delicioso!\n
793	Honey-Glazed Grilled Chicken and Penne Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, drain, toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and set aside.2 Meanwhile, heat ¼ cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, honey, and peppercorns and season with a little salt. Cook until the leeks are soft, 2 minutes, stirring occasionally and set aside.3 Grill the chicken on high heat for about 1½ minutes per side, or until slightly charred. Reduce the heat and cook for an additional 12 to 16 minutes, basting frequently with the honey-leek glaze, until cooked through. Transfer to a plate and set aside to cool; once cool, discard the skin, remove the meat from the bones and shred.\n\nStovetop Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil and sear the chicken thighs, skin-side down, until golden-brown, about 2 to 4 minutes. Turn the thighs over, transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Proceed shredding the chicken as instructed above.4 Place the vinegar and herbs in a large bowl. Whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and then add the meat, carrots and almonds. To serve, toss with the mixed greens, cooked pasta and some salt and ground black pepper to taste. \nServes 3-4, depending on whether or not this is a main course or a side salad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father found this recipe, by Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri, in the weekend Wall St. Journal and together we gave it a go. Dad’s been feeling under the weather recently, so it was nice to have him back in recipe research mode. Like many chef recipes, this one seemed a bit unnecessarily complicated, though the result was excellent. The flavors all worked together beautifully. If I were to make it again, I would probably skip the leeks in the basting sauce, and substitute lime juice for the sherry vinegar. Although when we were making the salad we thought that 3 ounces of penne didn’t quite seem enough, it ended up being just the right amount in proportion to everything else.\n
794	Mexican Red Chili Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Working on one chile at a time, use a paring knife to cut a slit all the way down one side of a chile.  Open up the chile and remove the stem and seeds.  Remove as much of the veins as you can.  Reserve a few of the seeds or veins for adding later if you want added heat. Note when working with chilies, either wear protective gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling the chilies.  Do not touch or rub your eyes if you have been handling chili peppers.\n\n2 Heat a large skillet on medium heat.  Flatten out the dried chilies as well as you can and place on the skillet to heat.  Press down on the opened chilies and leave for a few seconds.  Turn the chilies over and heat a few seconds more.  You do not want to toast or burn the chilies, just heat them enough to draw out more of the flavor.\n\n\n\n3 Add the chilies to a small saucepan and add enough water so that they are just covered.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes, until the chilies have softened and plumped up.   (OR pour place the chilies in a small saucepan and pour boiling water over them to cover.  Let sit for 15 minutes, until softened.)\n\n\n\n4 Reserving the soaking water, remove the chilies from the pan and place in a blender.  Add the garlic, salt, ground pepper, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid (taste the soaking water first, if it seems bitter, use water instead).  Purée for 2 minutes, until the sauce is completely smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning.  If you want more heat, add in a few of the seeds or veins and purée some more.  Add more salt if needed.\n\n\n\n5 Pour the sauce through a sieve into a skillet.  Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the sauce.  Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain the simmer, cook for 10 minutes.  Skim off the foam.  Remove from heat.  Use immediately or pour into a glass jar (plastic will get stained) and refrigerate.\n\nMakes a little more than 1 cup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Red chili sauces are used in many Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, such as red chile enchiladas or tamales. On doing research for this post I found references to many different ways of making red chile sauce; in Mexico alone there are as many ways to prepare this sauce as there are varieties of chilies, and even more when you take into account the regional twists. The following is a recipe for a basic red chili sauce, made with Ancho chilies (called by some Pasilla chiles – see notes). The basic technique was taught to me by my Mexican friend, Arturo Vargas, and helped along with notes from Diana Kennedy’s From My Mexican Kitchen: Techniques and Ingredients.\nWhy make your own sauce? Making your own chile sauce is not much different than making your own spaghetti sauce. If you have the time, it’s worth doing. In addition to creating a sauce with fantastic taste, dried chilies are inexpensive and easy to store. If you are making up a large batch of tamales, enchiladas, or chili beans you will likely need a lot of sauce, and if you make your own, you can easily make as much sauce as you need. Do you have a favorite recipe for Mexican or Tex-Mex chili sauce? If so, please let us know in the comments.\n
795	Ginger Pineapple Fried Rice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse rice in several changes of cold water in a large bowl until water runs clear. Drain in a colander. Place rice in a 4-quart heavy saucepan, then add water (amount according to the instructions on the package) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, again according to the package instructions, usually 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered and undisturbed, 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and let cool to almost room temperature. Chill, covered with plastic wrap, at least 4 hours.\n2 Heat a large (12-inch or more) heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 Tbsp of the oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When oil just begins to smoke, stir-fry ginger, white and pale green parts of scallions, and salt until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the remaining 2 Tbsp oil to the pan. Crumble rice into the pan and stir-fry until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat, then add scallion greens, pineapple, and sesame oil, tossing to combine. Season with salt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have some plain leftover rice? This is a great rice side dish for shrimp, pork, or chicken that calls for starting with chilled, cooked rice. I grilled some shrimp with some fresh pineapple the other day and served it with this ginger pineapple fried rice. Delicious! And very easy to make. You can probably substitute canned pineapple if fresh isn’t available.\n
796	Chipotle Grilled Chicken with Avocado Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a shallow bowl, stir together the olive oil, lime juice, and chipotle chile powder.\n2 Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of wax paper. Use a meat pounder to pound the breasts to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Cut off excess fat. If you are starting with 2 half-pound chicken breast halves, cut each one in half so that you have 4 pieces (to better fit the buns). Place the chicken breasts in the marinade, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes, preferably an hour.\n3 Heat your grill on high heat if you are using a gas grill, or prepare coals for direct heat if you are using charcoal. You can also use a cast-iron grill pan on your stove if you do not have a grill. Grill the chicken pieces a couple minutes on each side, until cooked through. Once you have cooked the chicken pieces on one side and flipped them, add a slice of cheese to the chicken. Cover the grill for half a minute to melt the cheese. Toast the buns on the grill as well.\n4 Assemble the sandwiches - bun bottom, chicken with melted cheese, avocado and lettuce, mayonnaise on the top bun.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We were, until recently, a family of non-grillers. While other Americans are happily firing away during the hot summer, filling up their neighborhoods with juicy aromas, we would tend to stay inside and think of what we could make for dinner that didn’t use the stove or oven. The problem is that Sacramento summers start early and go on forever, and cold food just gets tiring after a month or two. Which is why I brought home a grill a few weeks ago. Today’s grill experiment was this chipotle grilled chicken with Monterey Jack cheese and avocados on hamburger buns. I loved it, as did my guinea pig recipe testers Molly and David. By the way, I know there are probably some mayo haters out there. I tried it without mayo, and it was too dry. If you don’t like mayo, then mash up the avocados into a guacamole. You need the creaminess of either the avocado or the mayo to balance the spiciness of the chile and the roughness of the grilled bun.\n
808	Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put onion, garlic, rosemary, lemon zest, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil into a food processor and pulse to combine. (If you don't have a food processor, just chop the onions, garlic, and rosemary very well and combine with the rest.)\n2 Sprinkle a generous amount of salt and pepper over the lamb. Place marinade and lamb into a 1-gallon freezer bag. Spread marinade over all sides of the meat. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.\n\n3 Remove lamb from refrigerator and let come to room temperature (about 20 minutes). When ready to put on grill, remove from marinade bag. To help make the lamb easier to turn on the grill you can insert a couple of skewers through the lamb, crosswise. (A tip learned from Rick Rodgers in Kingsford Complete Grilling Cookbook.)\n4 Prepare grill. If you are using a charcoal grill, prepare the coals so that they are double layered on one side of the grill, and sparsely single layered on the other side of the grill (this is called "banked" grilling). If you are using a gas grill, heat the grill on high on all burners to start. After the initial browning you will reduce the heat.\n\n5 Place the lamb, fat side down, on the grill on the hot side (double layer charcoals). You will get likely get flareups, so be prepared with a squirt bottle of water or a couple of cups of water (if using a charcoal grill) to control the flames if needed. (My brother Matt swears by shaking the bottle of beer he is drinking to squirt some beer on the coals when needed for flareups.) Sear one side for 4 minutes, then flip the lamb over to sear the other side for another 4 minutes. Then, if you are using a charcoal grill, move the roast to the less hot side of the grill. If you are using a gas grill, lower the heat to low. You will want to maintain a temperature of 300-350°F. Cover the grill and let cook for an additional 35-45 minutes (depending on how thick, and how many pounds the roast is), until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast registers 130°F (for medium rare).\n6 Transfer to a cutting board with a well to catch the juices. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 5-10 minutes. Remove the skewers if you are using any. Cut across the grain, 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve slices on a warm platter; pour meat juices over the slices. Serve with mint jelly or horseradish. Serves 8-10.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Where to start? Somehow I suspect that the following method – fat is good, flame is good – is going to get me in trouble with some of you. But since this was the best lamb roast I’ve ever eaten in my life, I will forge ahead and tell you how we did it.\nThe lamb roast was succulent – crusty, flavorful char on the outside, pink and tender on the inside. Many recipes call for trimming off the excess fat from the lamb roast. I did that once to a prime rib roast and have never forgiven myself. Later I learned from my dear mother that “excess fat” was anything more than an inch thick in her book. The fat is needed to make the lamb tender and tasty. Trim it if you must, but leave some on.\nNote that the more fat on the lamb roast, the more likely you’ll have flare-ups when you grill. Flare-ups are okay as long as they are controlled and don’t get out of hand. The charring of the outside of the lamb, especially the fatty side, produces amazing flavor. By the way, it used to be that people were worried about char grilling being carcinogenic. Turns out if you marinate the meat in an acid-based marinade first, you negate the cancer-causing elements. (Grillers everywhere rejoice.)\nSome people take offense at the very idea of using mint jelly with lamb. I wouldn’t have lamb without it. Homemade mint jelly is fantastic with lamb. And if we’re out, I’ve been known to chop up some fresh mint leaves just to go with the lamb. So, to each her own when it comes to the jelly. What is your favorite way to prepare leg of lamb?\n
797	Penne with Ricotta and Asparagus	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Bring a large pot of water to a boil. (You will cook both the asparagus and the pasta in the same pot of water.) Add a couple teaspoons of salt. Have an ice bath ready. Add the asparagus and cook until tender but firm, about 4 minutes. Remove the asparagus with tongs and place in the ice bath to stop the cooking. Cut the asparagus into 1/8-inch diagonal slices, leaving the tips intact.\n2 Bring the water back to a boil and add the penne pasta.\n3 While the penne is cooking, rub the inside of a large serving bowl with the mashed garlic. Discard the garlic. Add the ricotta, olive oil, and 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water. Mix together in the bowl. When the pasta is done, drain it, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the penne to the ricotta mixture. Fold in the asparagus and half of the Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and several dashes of nutmeg. Add some of the reserved pasta water if needed.\nServes 4-8, depending on whether or not this is the main course. Serve with remaining grated Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl for sprinkling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	With California asparagus selling for less than $4 per pound, they’re hard to resist, especially with summer weather knocking on the door. I tore this recipe for pasta with asparagus and ricotta cheese out of the New York Times magazine a few weeks ago, where it found its way under a pile of bills, magazines, and other recipes, until today when it became my excuse to gleefully buy some what are sure to be last-of-the-season asparagus. I ammended the original recipe by adding a few dashes of nutmeg to the seasoning, for an added kick. This recipe is simple, both in taste and method, only requires one pot, and makes a huge amount. It’s a little heavy on the pasta, you could easily cut it back. You can also dress it up some by adding lemon zest, cut cherry tomatoes, or even some Italian sausage.\n
798	Zucchini Fritters	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Salt the zucchini with about 1 teaspoon of salt. Try to remove the excess moisture from the zucchini by either squeezing the liquid out with a potato ricer, or by squeezing with paper towels. (The original recipe calls for putting the zucchini in a colander set in the sink to let it drain for 10 minutes after salting it. I think it works much better to use a potato ricer.)\n2 Whisk egg in a large bowl; add the zucchini, flour, scallions, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Mix to combine well.\n3 Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook fritters in two batches. Drop six mounds of batter (2 Tbsp each) into the skillet. Flatten slightly. Cook, turning once, until browned, 4-6 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining batter.\nServe immediately, with sour cream or plain yoghurt on the side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Zucchini season is upon us, and already neighbors are coming by with bounty to share. Here is a favorite recipe for zucchini fritters, which look a lot like potato latkes, except without the potato. A tasty, easy option if you are trying to get your kids to eat more veggies. Plain yoghurt works just as well as a condiment with these as sour cream.\n
799	Cold Pea Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the frozen peas, green onions, almonds, and water chestnuts.  Mix together the mayonnaise and curry powder in a separate bowl.  \n\n2 Gently fold the mayonnaise mixture into peas.  Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n\nServes 6.\n\nNotes from Beth:  You make this salad the morning of, but add the almonds when you serve it.  The salad is still good the next day but it's best if it's made the day you serve.  Wonderful served with sliced tomato and avocado and chicken for lunch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This delightful cold pea salad recipe comes from my friend Chigiy‘s friend Beth, who brought it to a recent BBQ. It calls for Smokehouse Almonds, but I think it could easily be made with tamari almonds too. Perfect for picnics on hot summer days, it’s made with frozen peas which help keep the salad chilled. The peas do thaw a bit, but they’re good crunchy and cold too.\n
800	Plum Conserve	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare jars for canning in any of the following ways. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.  \n\n2 Put plums, sugar, orange, lemon, and raisins into a large 6 or 8-quart pan.  Heat until boiling.  Gently boil for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the mixture starts to thicken slightly.  Stir in walnuts.  \n\n\n\n3 Carefully ladle the conserve into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal. Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly. Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.\n\nMakes 5-6 pints.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A “conserve” is a jam made with a mixture of fruit, usually including some citrus, and often nuts and raisins. It can be served as a topping over pound cake, ice cream, or along side meat such as pork or chicken, or just on its own. This delicious recipe comes from a Simply Recipes reader, Lou Grubaugh, who shares her favorite old family recipe for plum conserve. We didn’t quite have the 3 pounds of tart plums that the recipe called for, so I substituted a few not-quite-ripe pluots, and some perfectly ripe plums too. For plums I used a combination of Santa Rosas (tart when not perfectly ripe) and Satsumas. Do you have a special plum recipe? See our post on plums and add your favorite to the comments of that post.\n
801	Ricotta-Mascarpone Mousse with Balsamic Strawberries	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium bowl, beat the cream until soft peaks form.\n 2 In a large bowl combine the ricotta, mascarpone, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and lemon zest. Using an electric beater, whip the ricotta-mascarpone mixture until thoroughly combined and smooth.\n3 Gradually fold the whipped cream into the ricotta until the mixture is smooth. Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours.\n4 Put strawberries in another bowl. Half an hour before serving gently mix in the remaining sugar and balsamic vinegar. Make sure you don't let the strawberries sit in the balsamic vinegar much longer than 30 minutes before serving or the acidity of the vinegar will cook the strawberries.\n5 When you are ready to serve, fill glass bowls halfway with the strawberries and their juices. Spoon on the ricotta-mascarpone mousse or use a pastry bag to pipe the mousse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Ever stumble upon something that everyone else seems to know about or has tried, but for you it’s a brand new oh-my-gosh discovery, and then you feel like an idiot, because, where have you been? For me, that something was the combination of fresh strawberries, sugar and balsamic vinegar. I’ve certainly heard rumblings about it (check out some of the links at the end of this recipe), but the idea of adding any kind of vinegar to strawberries just didn’t seem right. How wonderful to be oh-so-wrong. Of course you do need to use balsamic vinegar, an aged, deeply flavored, somewhat sweet vinegar; an ordinary vinegar probably won’t taste that good; if that’s all you have use some grated lemon zest and a little lemon juice instead. The mousse is extremely easy to make – folded together whipped cream, mascarpone and ricotta cheeses. This recipe is based on one from our local Sacramento food celebrity chef, Biba Caggiano, and is a great mostly make-ahead recipe for summer entertaining.\n
802	Broccoli Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Bring a large pot of water, salted with a teaspoon of salt, to a boil. Add the broccoli florets. Cook 1-2 minutes, depending on how crunchy you want the broccoli. 1 minute will turn the broccoli bright green, and leave it still pretty crunchy. 2 minutes will cook the broccoli through, but still firm. Set your timer and do not cook for more than 2 minutes, or the broccoli will get mushy. Drain the broccoli and immediately put into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Let cool and drain.\n2 Combine broccoli florets, almonds, crumbled bacon, chopped onion, and peas in a large serving bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, cider vinegar and honey. Add dressing to the salad and toss to mix well. Chill thoroughly before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The problem with most broccoli salads is the broccoli – the raw broccoli. Some people like raw broccoli, and actually, I love raw broccoli stems. They taste a lot like cabbage or cauliflower. But the florets? If they’re raw, keep them away please. So, how to make a broccoli salad if you don’t like raw broccoli? The solution – blanch the broccoli for 1 minute, or no more than two minutes. The broccoli will still be firm enough for the salad, the color will be even prettier, because blanching brings out the green, and the taste will be less raw and more cooked. In this recipe, the broccoli pairs wonderfully with the toasted almonds, bacon, peas, and onion. The honey and vinegar in the dressing adds some sweet and sour to the mix. Normally I cringe at the thought of broccoli salad, but honestly, this is one of the tastiest salads I’ve ever made, broccoli or not.\n
803	Poached Salmon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Sprinkle the salmon fillets with a little salt. Put the wine, water, dill, parsley and onions in a sauté pan, and bring to a simmer on medium heat.\n2 Place salmon fillets, skin-side down on the pan. Cover. Cook 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet, or to desired done-ness. Do not overcook. Serve sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This poached salmon recipe is one of the first recipes my father taught me a few years ago. It’s his favorite way to prepare salmon because not only can it be prepared in 10 minutes or less, but it doesn’t stink up the house the way broiling or frying salmon can, and it tastes simply delicious.\n
804	Chipotle Lime Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix together in a small bowl the lime zest, lime juice, olive oil, and chipotle powder. Put the shrimp in the lime chipotle mixture; make sure each piece is well coated.\n2 Spread the bacon pieces out over several layers of paper towels on a microwave-safe plate. Cover with another layer of paper towel. Microwave on high until the bacon fat begins to melt but the bacon is still pliable, about 1 1/2 minutes.\n3 Prepare grill on high, direct heat (if grilling) or preheat the oven to 450°F.\n4 Working one at a time, wrap a half piece of microwaved bacon around each piece of shrimp. If you are grilling, thread the shrimp onto long, flat skewers (flat skewers make turning the shrimp on the grill easier). If you don't have flat skewers, I've used two thin bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes beforehand) to the same effect. If you are using the oven, secure each the bacon onto the shrimp with toothpicks. Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp on a slotted baking pan (lined with foil inside for easy cleaning). Brush remaining lime chipotle mixture on the outside of the bacon-wrapped shrimp.\n\n5 Grill uncovered for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or bake in the oven for 10-14 minutes, until shrimp is pink and the bacon is crisp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When I put the call out a few weeks ago for July 4th grilling suggestions, Simply Recipes reader Chuck mentioned bacon-wrapped shrimp. I’m sure this is a standard fare for many of you, but I can’t remember ever eating bacon-wrapped shrimp, let alone making it. But boy, it sounds good, doesn’t it? Wonderfully indulgent. You actually don’t need anything beyond some good quality jumbo shrimp and bacon; they were perfectly delicious paired on their own the first time I made them. That said, dressing them up a bit with some lime juice and chipotle seasoning adds some fun layers of flavor.\n
805	Fingerling Potatoes with Herb Vinaigrette	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place potatoes in a medium pot and cover with cold water by about an inch.  Bring to a boil and add a teaspoon of salt to the water.  Lower the heat to a simmer and let simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, about 6-8 minutes.\n\n2 While potatoes are cooking, prepare the herb vinaigrette.   In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice shallots, thyme, basil, oregano, mustard, sugar, salt, pepper, and olive oil.\n\n3 Strain potatoes from the water and place them in a large bowl.  Sprinkle the potatoes generously with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle on the vermouth and toss to coat.  Let the potatoes sit for one minute to soak in the vermouth and then add the herb vinaigrette.  Gently toss until all potatoes are coated with the vinaigrette. Let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.\n\nServe slightly warm, room temperature, or chilled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I made these fingerling potatoes a few days ago as part of a composed salad and we loved them so much I made them again tonight just on their own, to accompany steak. These potatoes can be served warm, room temp, or cold. Chilled, they are perfect for hot summer days. Key ingredients are the vermouth and the chopped fresh herbs.\n
807	Martha’s Chinese Chicken Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1  Using two forks, shred the cooked chicken (if you don't have any already cooked, poach chicken pieces in simmering water until no longer pink inside).  Mix soy sauce, sherry and sugar in a bowl and add the chicken.  Let soak for 10 minutes.  Remove chicken and pat dry with paper towels.  Fry the shredded chicken in a little cooking oil on medium high heat to make it a little crispy and to bake in the seasoning.  Set aside.\n\n\n\n2 Put 3/4 inch of high smoke point cooking oil (such as grapeseed oil, or peanut oil) into a small saucepan.  Heat on high heat until when you flick a drop or two of water into the oil it sizzles.  Take one bunch of the dried bean threads and gently break them up a bit.  Test the oil by putting one bean thread into the oil.  If the oil is hot enough, the bean thread will almost immediately sizzle and puff up.  That's when you know the oil is hot enough.  Working with a few bean threads at a time, put them in the hot oil.  As soon as they puff up, remove them carefully with tongs and place them on a paper towel to cool.  The paper towel helps remove any excess oil.  Set aside.3 Cut your green onions, shredding them lengthwise as shown.  Toast your chopped almonds, or chop your toasted almonds; toast your sesame seeds.  (Heat a thin skillet to medium high heat, add the seeds - or nuts, don't do them both together - stir frequently until they begin to brown, remove from heat, they will continue to cook.  Let cool to room temp.)\n\n4 Mix all of the sauce ingredients together, in the order listed.  Just before serving the salad, mix all of the salad ingredients together - lettuce, chicken, bean threads, almonds, sesame seeds, and sauce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	No, not that Martha. This Martha is a friend of my friend Suzanne, who prepared her favorite chicken salad for a gathering of girlfriends a while back. A great recipe for summer picnics (you might want to double the recipe).\n
809	Cucumber Salad with Mint and Feta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn a medium sized bowl, gently toss together the sliced cucumbers, red onion, radishes, mint leaves with a little bit of white vinegar and olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Right before serving, sprinkle on crumbled bits of feta cheese. Serve immediately. Serves 4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When the hot weather hits, nothing is more cooling than a cucumber salad. Inspired by a fabulous cucumber salad shared with a friend at the Sea Salt restaurant in Berkeley, I canvassed my neighborhood grocers for some delicate Persian cucumbers. Have you ever eaten a Persian cucumber? Unlike the somewhat seedy American cucumbers with thick, bitter skins, Persian cucumbers are thin-skinned and practically seedless, so you can just slice them and eat them, without peeling. They can be hard to locate (even our local Iranian market didn’t have them), so you might try making this salad with English cucumbers which are also thin skinned and mostly seed-free. The combination of cucumber, mint, and feta cheese is really quite lovely.\n
810	Ricotta Stuffed Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels.  Butterfly the chicken by using poultry shears or a knife to cut along one side of the backbone.  Cut along the other side and remove the backbone and tail.  Spread the chicken open, skin side up.  Press down on the chicken with the palms of your hands (or pound with your fists) to flatten the chicken.  Skewer neck skin to back.  \n\n2 In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, garlic,  2 teaspoons of chopped basil, and 1 teaspoon of chopped tarragon.\n\n\n\n3  Using a sharp paring knife and your fingers, loosen skin over top of chicken and drumsticks starting at neck edge.  Carefully spoon cheese mixture\nunder skin of chicken, pressing with your fingers to distribute evenly over the chicken\nand drumsticks. \n\n4 Brush chicken lightly with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon tarragon, paprika, and a generous amount of salt.  \n\n5a Grilling method\n\nPrepare grill for medium indirect heat.  If using a gas grill, heat all burners on high until the grill is hot, then turn off the middle burner.  If using a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side of the grill and place a large aluminum drip pan underneath the grate on the side without coals, adding a couple cups of water to the drip pan so that the drippings don't burn.\n\nPlace the chicken, skin side up, on the cooking grate, away from the side with coals if you are using a charcoal grill, or above the middle burner if you are using gas.  Alternatively, you can lay the chicken out on a rack in a disposable aluminum roasting pan and place the roasting pan on the cooking grate (this tip works well with gas grills, I haven't tried it with the charcoal one yet).  Cover the grill.\n\n5b Oven method\nPreheat oven to 500°F.  Place chicken, skin side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.  Place in oven and immediately turn the heat down to 350°F.\n\n6 Roast for an hour to an hour and a half, until the juices run clear from the thigh when pierced with a fork.  (Breast meat should have an internal temperature of 165°F, thigh meat should have an internal temperature of 175°F.)  Transfer chicken to a cutting board; let stand 10 minutes. Cut into quarters, cutting lengthwise and crosswise. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This ricotta stuffed chicken recipe is based on a recipe from a Weber grilling cookbook, and as such requires that you butterfly the chicken (makes it easier to grill). Although the recipe is designed for grilling, it can easily be done in the oven. The ricotta cheese and the herbs make for a truly tasty chicken, filling, but not too rich.\n \nTo butterfly a chicken, you cut it open on one side, spread open the chicken and lay it flat. The benefits of laying the chicken out flat is that it makes it easier to grill and faster to roast. Traditionally butterflying a chicken is done by cutting the chicken open along the backbone, and then removing the backbone and tail. But if you haven’t the faintest idea what you are doing (“Uh, dad, I think we just cut the chicken open on the breast side”), it will still work, as long as you can flatten out the chicken.\n
811	Pineapple Upside Down Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Start by making the caramel topping.  Take brown sugar and butter and combine and melt in a saucepan on medium heat until sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbly, this should take several minutes.  (After sugar melts, don't stir.)  Pour mixture into a 10 inch diameter stick-free cake pan with 2 inch high sides.  Arrange pineapple slices in a single layer ontop of the caramel mixture.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Whisk the flours, almonds, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the sugar and butter together until light.  Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.  Beat in the vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with  sour cream in 2 additions each, beating well after each addition.  Pour cake batter over caramel and pineapple in pan.\n\n3 Bake cake until tester  inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on a rack for 10 minutes.  Turn cake out onto a platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature.\n\nMakes 12 to 14 servings.\n\n* Note an alternative topping that my father is favoring these days.  2 cups granulated sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup butter.  Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan.  Heat on medium until all sugar is dissolved.  Increase heat to medium high and bring to a boil.  Boil until syrup becomes warm amber in color (about 10 minutes).  Add 1/4 cup butter, carefully as it will foam up a bit.  Swirl the pan so that the butter is all incorporated, stirring with a wooden spoon if necessary.  Remove from heat and pour out into cake pan.  Continue with recipe as noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This pineapple upside-down cake is one of my father’s favorite recipes (he’ll look for almost any excuse to make it). The cake is wonderfully dense, with a slight almond flavor and with sweetness from caramel and pineapple. Dad has recently changed the way he makes the caramel topping, so I’ve added this alternative approach as an addendum to the instructions.\n
817	Cold Tomato Summer Vegetable Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine all ingredients in a large bowl. Use the additional tomato juice to thin the soup to desired consistency. Adjust seasonings to taste.  Better the next day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father made this cold tomato and zucchini soup the other day. \n“Don’t call it gazpacho.” \n“Why not? It looks like gazpacho, but with some zucchini.” \n“It’s my soup. I made it up. It’s not gazpacho. Don’t call it gazpacho.” \n“Okay dad, whatever you say.”\nSo instead, my brother Eddie has named it “The Farmer’s Market in a Soup”. And, given that dad brought home every ingredient except the seasonings and broth from our local farmers market, the name makes sense. It is a wonderfully cool, fresh soup for a hot summer day. Just don’t call it gazpacho.\n
812	Napa Cabbage Picnic Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Spread almond slivers out in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.  Toast in a 350°F oven for 5-10 minutes, until nicely browned.  OR toast in stick-free or cast-iron skillet on medium high, stirring frequently until browned.  Set aside.\n\n2 Combine cabbage, snow peas, radishes, green onions, cilantro in a large bowl.  Can make this step a day or two ahead.\n\n3 In a separate bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil, ginger, and cayenne until sugar has dissolved.  Whisk in the mayonnaise.\n\n4 When ready to serve, gently combine the dressing and almonds with the cabbage mixture.\n\nServes 14-16.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every year around the Fourth of July, my friends Rich and Chigiy throw a huge barbecue party for their friends, and for number two son Dashiell, a July 4th baby. Every year, the talented Chigiy (pronounced “chi-gee”) makes this terrific salad with Chinese napa cabbage, radishes, snow peas, toasted slivered almonds, and a sweet soy mayo dressing. And every year, the salad all gets eaten before most get a chance to taste it, and before I am able take a photo. This year, however, Chigiy tripled the recipe (which already serves 15) and had enough left for me to capture on a pretty plate. This is a truly great salad for large summer gatherings. Much of it can be made ahead, and then assembled when you are ready to serve. Enjoy.\n
813	Stove-top Baked Beans	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  If you are using canned beans, drain the beans, put them in a large pot and skip to step 4. Put dry beans in a large pot.  Cover with water by 2 inches and refrigerate overnight.  Alternatively, bring beans to a boil, remove from heat and let cool for an hour.\n\n2 Drain the beans and rinse them.  Add them to a large pot.  Cover with 1 inch of water.  Insert cloves into onion halves (so they can be easily found and discarded later), add to pot.  Add garlic and bay leaf.  Heat to a simmer and let cook for 1 to 2 hours, until beans are just tender.  (Older beans will take longer to cook).  Add boiling water to beans if they begin to look dry while cooking.\n\n3  Remove onion, cloves, and bay leaf.  Add 1 teaspoon of salt.  \n\n4 In a separate bowl, mix together the ketchup, molasses, vinegar, mustard powder, Tabasco sauce, and pepper.  Add mixture to beans and stir to combine.  Add one slice of raw bacon to the mix.  Bring the beans to a simmer.  Simmer over low heat for 30-40 minutes until thick.  Remove bacon slice (if desired).  Add more salt to taste.\n\nServe hot, topped with chopped red onions and cooked bacon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Why is it that baked beans are so popular around the Fourth of July, but making them usually requires several hours of baking in a hot oven? Where we live it gets pretty darn sizzling in the summer and the last thing we want to do is keep the oven going for hours; the AC is working hard enough as it is. Here’s a recipe I pulled from the New York Times back in February that calls for cooking the beans on the stove top, a much preferred summer cooking method. Richly flavored with bacon, molasses, ketchup and vinegar, these not-really-baked beans have plenty of the baked bean goodness you expect, and are great with hot dogs.\n
815	Arugula Corn Salad with Bacon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook the corn ears, in their husks, either on the grill for a smokey flavor, or by steaming in a large covered stock pot with an inch of boiling water at the bottom of the pot, for 12-15 minutes.  Let the corn cool (can run under cold water to speed up the cooling), remove the husks and silk.  I recommend cooking the corn in the husks for the added flavor that the husks impart.  If you boil or steam the corn ears after you've already husked them, or if you cook them in the microwave, reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\n\n\n\n2 To remove the kernels from the cobs, stand a corn cob vertically over a large, shallow bowl.  Use a sharp knife to make long, downward strokes, removing the kernels from the cob, as you work your way around the cob.  Note: it may help to work over a low table, to be in a better ergonomic position to cut the cobs this way. \n\n3 In a medium sized bowl, mix together the corn, chopped arugula, bacon, and onions.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and cumin.  Mix dressing into salad just before serving.  Taste and add more vinegar if necessary to balance the sweetness of the corn.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This is a salad of bold flavors, but somehow they all manage to work together well. Sweet corn tossed with peppery arugula, bacon, onion, cumin, and wine vinegar to balance the sweet corn, and you have stimulated all the major tastes your tongue can perceive. If you have a grill, and the time, I highly recommend grilling the corn (in their husks) for this recipe; the smokey flavor just can’t be beat.\n
816	Grilled Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Hot Dogs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare your grill for direct medium high heat.\n\n2 Mix together the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl.   In a separate bowl, mix the sauerkraut with the chopped onion, set aside.  Slice open the hot dogs, down the center, lengthwise, forming a deep pocket in each, but not cutting all the way through.  Coat the inside of each hot dog with the mustard ketchup mixture.  \n\n3 Place a strip of cheese deep within the pocket of each hot dog.  Top with sauerkraut and onions.  Encapsulate the cheese at the ends with the sauerkraut mixture as well, so that no cheese is exposed (otherwise it will drip out when cooking).  \n\n\n\n4 Wrap a strip of bacon around each stuffed hot dog, securing with toothpicks at each end.  Make sure you wrap tight enough so that the stuffing stays in, but not so tight so that when the hot dog expands will cooking the bacon would tear.\n\n\n\n5 Coat your grill surface with vegetable oil so that the hot dogs don't stick.  If you have a grill screen (a screen with smaller holes so that small pieces of whatever you're cooking don't fall through the grill), you can use it, just coat it with vegetable oil first and pre-heat for a couple of minutes.  Place the stuffed hot dogs on the grill, stuffing side down.  Grill for 2 minutes, until the bacon on that side is cooked, turn the hot dogs a quarter turn and grill for a couple more minutes.  Continue to grill for a few minutes each on all sides until the bacon is cooked.  Cover the grill in between turnings to help with the cooking.\n\n6 During the last minute of cooking, open up the hot dog buns and place them open-side down on the grill to lightly toast.  \n\n7 Remove the hot dogs and buns from the grill.  Remove the toothpicks fro the hot dogs, place them in the buns and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I remarked to my father than we had been doing a lot of salads and veggies lately and without missing a beat dad said, “I want to make stuffed hot dogs,” adding, “on the grill,” pointing to a particularly appetizing recipe in our Mastering the Grill cookbook. Note that, in spite of gender stereotypes, my he-man father is the main baker in our family, and I am in charge of anything to do with the grill. (Mom avoids both grilling and baking.) So, when dad says he wants to make a grilled recipe, he means that he wants me to do the cooking, while he’ll do the prepping, which is more than fine by me.\nDo you like hot dogs, mustard, ketchup, cheese, onions, sauerkraut and bacon? Then this is the stuffed hot dog recipe for you. It’s all in there, held in place by a wrapping of bacon around the hot dog. You can easily exchange the toppings for others, though note that the sauerkraut does help keep the cheese inside the hot dog while cooking.\n
818	Tarragon Tuna Melt	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Mix the green onion, parsley, tarragon, lemon juice, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and mayonnaise in a medium sized bowl.   Add the drained tuna, mixing with a fork to break up the flakes.\n\n\n\n2 Lay out four slices of bread.  Divide the tuna mixture evenly onto the slices.  Top each bread slice with tomato slices and grated cheese.  Spread one side of the remaining four bread slices with butter.  Place bread slices, buttered side up, on top of the cheese.\n\n\n\n3 Heat a large griddle, on medium heat (or couple cast iron skillets).  Place the sandwiches, buttered side down, onto the hot griddle.  Gently spread butter on top of the bread slices.  Cook for about 3 minutes, or until nicely browned on one side. Then use a metal spatula to lift up the sandwiches and carefully turn them to the other side.  Cook for another 3 minutes or so, until the second side is browned.\n\nServe immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What is a tuna melt, other than a grilled cheese sandwich dressed up with tuna salad? Two favorite food groups, merged together. I used to love these sandwiches as a kid, and was inspired by a Karen Tedesco recipe in Better Homes and Gardens to make this slightly more fancy version with tarragon. Do you like tuna melts? If so, how do you like yours? Please let us know in the comments.\n
819	Cranberry Limeade	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil so that the sugar is completely dissolved, and remove from heat.  If you want an added zing to your limeade, zest a couple of the limes before juicing and add the zest to the sugar water while it's heating.  Once the syrup has cooled, strain out the zest with a fine mesh strainer before using.\n\n2 While your simple syrup is cooling, juice the limes. \n\n3 Add lime juice, cranberry juice, 1 1/2 cups of cold water, the simple syrup, and a few ice cubes to a serving pitcher.  Depending on when and how the limeade is to be served, and how strong you want it, you can add more ice and water.  For example, if you want to serve it right away, and it is still a bit warm from the hot simple syrup, add lots of ice.  If it has had a chance to cool down and chill in the refrigerator, but is still too strong, add a bit more water until the strength is to your preference.\n\nIf the cranberry limeade is too sweet for your taste, add some more lime juice and water until you reach your desired level of sweetness, and use less sugar the next time you make it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Once in a while, Trader Joe’s has a great deal on limes; you can get a whole one pound bag for 99 cents. I’ll buy a bag with the best of intentions to put them to good use, but then most recipes that use lime only call for one. Not the 10 that are in the bag. Unfortunately, limes don’t have the shelf life that we enjoy with lemons. A lime’s peel turns yellow and then brown fairly quickly, and limes tend to dry out sooner than you would expect (compared to lemons). Here is a zesty summer drink you can easily make with those extra limes. Limeade itself can be rather tart (though alone it is still one of my favorite drinks); adding a bit of cranberry juice, sour cherry, or pomegranate juice, can take the edge off the lime while adding another dimension of flavor. I’m thinking this one would also make a great juice popsicle.\n
820	Spicy Grilled Turkey Burger with Coleslaw	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare your grill (either gas or charcoal) for direct high heat. You can also cook the burgers on the stove-top on a griddle or cast iron frying pan.\n\n2 In a large bowl, gently combine the turkey meat, bread crumbs, chives, basil, green onions, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, chili sauce, salt and pepper.  Work the mixture with your hands until it is just mixed.  Don't over mix or your burgers will end up tough.  Form four patties, about 1-inch thick.\n\n\n\n3 Sprinkle the patties with salt and pepper.  Grill them for 5-7 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature of the patties reach 170°F on a meat thermometer.  Turkey burgers should be cooked through, not rare.  Toward the end of the cooking, put the buns on the grill to toast for about a minute.  Remove the burgers from the grill to a platter, cover and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\n4 Assemble the coleslaw.  Whisk the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, sugar, red pepper flakes together in a small bowl.  Add to the cabbage, arugula, and basil in a larger bowl right before serving.\n\n5 Assemble the burgers by placing each burger on a bottom bun, and stacking a tomato slice, some pickles, and a bit of coleslaw on top, and then topping with the top bun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recently my father announced he had a cunning plan. He found a grilled turkey burger recipe that he wanted to try, but rather than just use any old ground turkey, he would make half the burgers with ground dark meat (his favorite) and half the burgers with ground white meat and see if he preferred one over the other. I complicated the test further by suggesting that we use regular Tabasco sauce with the white meat turkey burgers and chipotle Tabasco sauce with the dark meat burgers, thinking that the stronger flavor of dark meat would hold up well to the chipotle. Dad took the test a step further and decided that we would have half as much chili sauce in the white meat burgers. Clearly we weren’t aiming for a perfect scientific study.\n \nThe good news is that both sets of burgers turned out great. With the white meat turkey burgers, since we had less chili sauce, the turkey flavor was more pronounced. With the dark meat burgers, the chipotle sauce added a lot of kick to the meat. Both burgers were flavorful, filling, and paired very well with the spicy coleslaw, sweet pickles, and tomatoes. 3 thumbs up on this one.\n
821	How to Roast Green Chiles over a Gas Flame	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Turn on your gas burner on to the highest setting. Balance the chile pepper directly on the metal grates over the gas burner. Let the chile pepper sit on the burner as its skin begins to bubble and turn black (about a minute).\n\n2 Once one side of the chile gets well blistered, use tongs (or if you can, grab the stem with your fingers) to turn the chile to another side. Repeat until the chile gets blistered or charred on all sides. Obviously you need to pay close attention to the chile. It should just blister and char a bit, not catch fire.\nUsing this method you can roast several chiles at the same time. At least 2 per burner, and you can have a couple burners going at once.\n\n3 Place the chile in a bowl and cover with a plate (or put the chile in a brown paper bag and close the bag). Let the chiles sit for 5 or 10 minutes. The steam from the hot chile will help the peel come off more easily.\n\n4 Remove the chile from the bowl. Use your fingers or a damp towel or damp paper towel to rub off the charred peel. You may find it easier to do this over a sink, because it can get rather messy. Try to avoid running water over the chile itself, as doing so may wash away some of the chile's flavor. Make a slice into the side of the chile and cut away and discard the stem, seeds, and veins.\nPlace in a covered container and refrigerate. Will keep for several days in the fridge. Or you can place in a freezer bag, press out the air, and freeze. Frozen chiles will last for several months.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated Aug 15th, 2013, now with a video! \nGreen chiles—Hatch, Anaheim, poblanos—are staples of southwestern cooking, and almost every recipe that uses them requires that they be roasted first. To roast a green chile you need to char the outside peel, without burning the inside, and then remove the char. The easiest way to do this for a small batch is over an open flame of a gas stove. You can also char them on a grill, or under a broiler. You can even char them on an electric range (my mother has been known to put the chiles directly on the electric coil, though probably set on a sturdy metal roasting rack a little bit above the coil would work with less mess.) The secret to roasting a chile pepper is to char or blister the skin all over, so the skin is easy to peel off. My mother prefers charring the chiles over a gas stove to her (electric) broiler because cooking directly over the flame chars the peel faster and doesn’t overcook the chile. To show you how easy this is to do, we’ve put together a short video, take a look!\n\n\n
822	Perfect Popcorn	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan on medium high heat.\n2 Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil and cover the pan.\n3 When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer. Cover, remove from heat and count 30 seconds. (Count out loud; it's fun to do with kids.) This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time.\n4 Return the pan to the heat. The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner. Try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper). Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan from the heat, remove the lid, and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl.\nWith this technique, nearly all of the kernels pop (I counted 4 unpopped kernels in my last batch), and nothing burns.\n5 If you are adding butter, you can easily melt it by placing the butter in the now empty, but hot pan.\n6 Salt to taste.\nAdditional tips: From the comments section\na If you add salt to the oil in the pan before popping, when the popcorn pops, the salt will be well distributed throughout the popcorn.\nb Fun toppings for the popcorn - Spanish smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne powder, chili pepper, curry powder, cumin, grated Parmesan cheese.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Making popcorn from scratch can be tricky. Not only do you want as many kernels as possible to pop, but you also want to keep the kernels from burning at the bottom of the pan. Until my mother showed me her way of cooking popcorn, I usually took the easy way out and used (gasp!) microwave popcorn, which by the way, is not that good for you.\nMom’s method of making popcorn not only pops almost every kernel, it also prevents the kernels from burning. She took it off of a Jiffy Popcorn box, she thinks. Here’s how it goes:\n
834	Chai Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Into a heavy saucepan put the 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of the cream and the chai spices - star anise, cloves, allspice, cinnamon sticks, white peppercorns, and cardamom pods, and a pinch of salt.  Heat the mixture until steamy (not boiling) and hot to the touch.  Lower the heat to warm, cover, and let stand for 1 hour.\n\n2 Reheat the mixture until steamy hot again (again not boiling), add the black tea leaves, remove from the heat, stir in the tea and let seep for 10 minutes.  Use a fine mesh strainer to strain out the tea and spices, pouring the infused milk cream mixture into a separate bowl.  Return the milk cream mixture back to the heavy bottomed saucepan.  Add the sugar to the milk cream mixture and heat, stirring, until the sugar is fully dissolved.\n\n3 While the tea is infusing in step 2, prepare the remaining 1 cup of cream over an ice bath. Pour the cream into a medium size metal bowl, set in ice water (with lots of ice) over a larger bowl. Set a mesh strainer on top of the bowls. Set aside.\n\n4 Whisk the egg yolks in a medium sized bowl. Slowly pour the heated milk cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm mixture, but not cooked by it. Scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.\n\n5 Return the saucepan to the stove, stirring the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run. This can take about 10 minutes.  The minute this happens the mixture should be removed from heat immediately, and poured through the sieve over the ice bath to stop the cooking (step 6).\n\nIf the custard base doesn't coat the back of the spoon, it's not ready.\n\nThe custard base coats the back of the spoon.\n\n6 Pour the custard through the strainer (from step 2) and stir into the cold cream to stop the cooking. \n\n7 Once initially chilled in the ice bath, chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator (at least a couple of hours). Freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n8 Store in an airtight container in your freezer for several hours before eating.  Note that the ice cream will be quite soft coming out of the ice cream maker.  It will continue harden in your freezer.  If stored for more than a day, you may need to let it sit for a few minutes to soften before attempting to scoop it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	According to historian Lizzie Collingham in her terrific Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors, the English popularized tea drinking in India in the early 1900s as a way to expand the market for the tea they were growing there. To the great distress of the British marketers of the time, the locals insisted on adding way more sugar and milk than would be considered proper by English standards and, adding insult to injury, spicing it up a bit with cardamom, pepper, cinnamon. All I can say is Thank Goodness. Spicy, milky, sweet chai is one of my favorite ways to drink black tea. Here are all those wonderful chai tea spices infused in ice cream.\n
823	Plum Galette	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium sized bowl, gently toss the plum slices with the raisins, pecans, lemon zest, flour and sugar.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 375°F.  If you are using homemade chilled pie dough, remove it from the refrigerator to let stand for 10 minutes before rolling out.\n\n3 Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the pie dough to a 13-inch round of even thickness.\n\n4 Place rolled-out pie dough in the center of a small-rimmed, lightly buttered baking sheet.  Place plum mixture in the center of the pie dough round, leaving a border of 2 inches on all sides.  Fold the edges of the pie crust up and over so that circle of the filling is visible.\n\n5 Place in the middle rack of the oven.  Bake at 375°F for 40-50 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly.  Cool on a rack for an hour before serving.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We’ve got plums coming out the wazoo at the moment. Every time I mention a potential plum recipe my mother’s eyes light up with what appears to be frantic joy; she can’t give them away fast enough and she’s tired of making plum freezer jam (20 pints and counting). Unfortunately, the plums required for this recipe hardly put a dent in her inventory; little more than a pound is needed. But this rustic plum tart (also called a galette) is bright and delicious, and a great way to put some extra plums to work. With different varieties of plums, some raisins, and pecans all adding to the mix, every bite has a slightly different flavor, all good. We even threw in a few tart pluots for added measure.\n
824	Spicy Corn Fritters	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Make the dipping sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients into a small saucepan.  Cook on medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat to medium high, let boil for 5-10 minutes or so, until the mixture becomes somewhat syrupy.  Remove from heat and let cool.  The sauce should continue to thicken as it cools.  If it becomes too thick, you can add a little water to it to thin it out a bit.\n\n\n\n2 Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, ground coriander, and ground cumin in a medium bowl.  Add egg, lemon juice and water.  Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until smooth.  Add the corn, onions, and cilantro.  Stir until just combined.\n\n\n\n3 Heat a large frying pan on medium high heat.  Add enough oil to generously coat the bottom of the pan.  When oil is hot (shimmering not smoking), spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons worth of fritter batter into the pan to form one fritter, patting it down with the back of the spoon as soon as it is in the pan.  Work in batches.  Leave about 1/2 inch between the fritters in the pan.  Let cook about 2-3 minutes on each side, flipping the fritters when they are nicely browned on one side.  When browned on the other side, remove the fritters to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat.\n\nAdd oil as needed to keep the bottom of the pan well coated.  Note that the fritters will likely splatter a bit as you are cooking.  So, either use a screen splatter guard, or wear long sleeved clothes while you cook.\n\nServe immediately with the sweet chili dipping sauce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What would be your dream diet? You know, the diet in which you could really eat anything you wanted, and as much as you wanted. If you asked me at dinner tonight, I would have to say, spicy corn fritters. Yep, the corn fritter diet. (Haven’t you heard of it?) Just pile ‘em on. One bite of freshly made fritters made with farm fresh corn, dipped in a sweet chili sauce, and nothing else seems even remotely appealing. Of course, a few weeks of nothing but corn fritters and you’re on the road to pellagra, but one can dream, can’t one?\n
825	Zucchini Ricotta Frittata	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Beat the eggs in a medium bowl.  Add the ricotta and Parmesan and beat to combine.  Add the salt, freshly ground black pepper, basil and thyme and beat to combine.  Set aside.\n\n\n\n2 Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch oven-proof stick-free skillet on medium high.  When the oil is hot and begins to shimmer, add the zucchini slices.  Stir so that the zucchini slices are all coated with some of the oil.  Cook, stirring only occasionally (if you stir too much the zucchini won't brown), until the zucchini slices are lightly browned, about 5-6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Remove zucchini slices from the pan with tongs or a slotted spoon to a bowl.  Let cool for 30 seconds or so, and then stir the zucchini slices to the egg mixture.\n\n\n\n3 Reheat the skillet.  There should be a couple of tablespoons of oil left in the pan, if not, add some.  When the oil is hot, pour the egg mixture into the pan.  Do not stir it.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Let the egg mixture cook.  Run a spatula along the edge of the frittata, separating the cooked edges from the pan.  Let the egg mixture cook until the bottom is golden brown and the top is beginning to set, about 5-6 minutes.\n\n\n\n4 Set the top rack 5 inches from the heating element in the oven.  Preheat the oven broiler.  Once the top of the frittata has started to set in the pan on the stove top, remove the pan from the stove and place it in the oven.  With the broiler on, the door of the oven needs to be open.  You can let the pan's handle stick out from the oven through the open door.  Cook under the broiler until the top starts to become lightly browned, about 2 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, instead of using the broiler, you can place a plate face-down on top of the skillet.  Flip the skillet over to release the frittata on to the plate.  Then slide the frittata from the plate back on to the skillet.  Let cook for a couple of minutes more until the bottom side gets browned.\n\n5 Slide the frittata out of the skillet onto a serving plate.  Let cool for a minute or two and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Did you know that yesterday was “Dump Your Extra Zucchini On Your Neighbor’s Doorstep Day”? According to our local newspaper it was, though I think they may have been joshing. Then again, maybe not. This excellent zucchini ricotta frittata recipe (like the way that just rolls of one’s tongue? “ricotta frittata, ricotta frittata”) is based on one by our local cherished chef Biba. It’s a cinch to make and a tasty way of enjoying bountiful summer squash.\n
826	Buttermilk Fried Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Soak chicken overnight (at least 8 hours and up to two days) in buttermilk with onions, herbs, paprika, and cayenne pepper. (Regarding the use of buttermilk, my mother has had good results from soaking chicken in plain yogurt instead of buttermilk.)\n2 Drain in a colander, leaving some of the herbs on chicken. In a large paper or plastic (sturdy) bag, mix flour with seasonings. Meanwhile, heat 2 cups of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet (cast iron, stainless steel, or anodized aluminum - something that can take the heat) on medium high heat until a pinch of flour starts to sizzle when dropped in the hot oil (but not so hot that the pan is smoking). Remember when working with hot oil, always have a pan lid close by.\n\n3 Place chicken pieces in bag with flour and shake until thoroughly coated. Add chicken to hot pan and fry on 1 side for 12-15 minutes, until golden brown, and then use tongs to turn the pieces over and fry for another 10-12 minutes, again until golden brown.\nBe careful to keep the oil hot enough to fry the chicken, but not so high as it burns the chicken. To do this on our electric stove we have to alternate the settings between high to medium high several times while we are cooking.\n\n4 Use tongs to remove chicken from pan. Place on a rack over a cookie sheet or broiling pan for the excess oil to drain. Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recently at dinner my father instructed me, “tell your website readers that your dad says this is a good one.” Done, dad. This chicken is good—perfectly tender, well flavored, crunchy—just what one wants in fried chicken. The secret? Buttermilk. Buttermilk is lightly acidic. Soaking the chicken overnight in buttermilk helps tenderize it, and the chicken stays tender when you fry it. It’s important to use a high smoke point oil when frying chicken (or anything else for that matter). We use rice bran oil, canola oil, or grapeseed oil, all of which have high smoke points. In other words, they can take being heated to the high temperature needed in frying without smoking or burning. Many recipes call for frying chicken in a cast iron frying pan. Sometimes we use one of our trusty cast iron pans, and sometimes a hard anodized aluminum pan. Cast iron tends to be quite heavy. It retains heat so well that if you have a problem and have to lower the heat rapidly, you won’t be able to do it. Anodized aluminum can also take the heat without warping, but will be more responsive for heating and cooling. (I’ve started a kitchen fire with peanut oil in a cast iron skillet – not fun – if it ever happens to you, remove the pan from the heat element, and cover it quickly with a lid.)\n
827	Chocolate Zucchini Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreheat the oven to 350°F.\n1 Set the shredded zucchini to drain in a sieve over a bowl. If no moisture drains out and the zucchini feels dry, sprinkle some water over it and let the excess drain.\n\n2 Vigorously whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, soda, salt, and cinnamon in a bow, and set aside.\n\n3 With a mixer, beat together the butter and the sugars until smooth. Add the eggs to the butter and sugar mixture one at a time, beating well after each addition. With a wooden spoon, stir in the vanilla, orange peel, and zucchini.\n4 Alternately stir in the dry ingredients and the milk into the zucchini mixture, including the nuts with the last addition.\n\n5 Spray the inside of a 10-inch bundt pan or tube pan lightly with cooking spray (or grease with butter). Wipe off the excess. Pour in the batter and use a rubber spatula to level the top of the batter. Bake in the oven for about 50-55 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean (test at 45 min). Cool in pan 15 minutes; turn out on wire rack to cool thoroughly.\n\n6 Make the glaze by mixing together the glaze ingredients. You can easily do this by hand with a whisk or a spoon. If the glaze is too runny, add some more powdered sugar. If too thick, add more milk. Drizzle glaze over cake.\nCut in thin slices to serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated Sept 15, 2012*\nWhen I first encountered Clotilde Dusoulier’s fabulous Chocolate and Zucchini website, I thought to myself, “How wonderful, the ingredients of my favorite cake!” My grandmother taught me how to bake when I was very young, and later when I was in high school she sent us a recipe pulled from Sunset Magazine for Chocolate and Zucchini Cake. Being adventurous, and knowing how good zucchini bread tastes, I tried it and it quickly became my favorite – the standard against which all future chocolate cakes were measured. Over the years, I’ve modified this cake recipe slightly from the original. I use more zucchini, and a mix of white and brown sugars. The main distinction of chocolate zucchini cake is its moistness. The zucchini absorbes the cocoa while delivering the full flavor of chocoate, but without the heaviness of some other chocolate cakes.\n\n
828	Nicoise Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*Marinate tuna steaks in a little olive oil for an hour. Heat a large skillet on medium high heat, or place on a hot grill. Cook the steaks 2 to 3 minutes on each side until cooked through.\n1 In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, oil, shallot, thyme, basil, oregano, and mustard. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.\n2 Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with 4 quarts of cold water. Bring to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt and cook until potatoes are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain. Toss warm potatoes with 1/4 cup vinaigrette; set aside.\n3 While the potatoes are cooking, in a separate pot, add a quart of water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil. Add the green beans to the pot. Blanch until tender but still a little firm, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the beans from the pot and place in ice water to stop the cooking. After about 30 seconds, drain the beans. Toss the beans in 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and add salt and pepper to taste.\n4 While potatoes and green beans are cooking, toss lettuce with 1/4 cup vinaigrette in large bowl until coated. Arrange bed of lettuce on a serving platter (I used two serving platters, shown in the photos). Cut tuna into 1/2-inch thick slices, coat with vinaigrette. Mound tuna in center of lettuce. Toss tomatoes, red onion, 3 tablespoons vinaigrette, and salt and pepper to taste in bowl; arrange tomato-onion mixture on the lettuce bed. Arrange the  potatoes and green beans in mounds at edge of lettuce bed.\n5 Arrange hard boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies (if using) in mounds on the lettuce bed. Drizzle eggs with remaining 2 tablespoons dressing, sprinkle entire salad with capers (if using), and serve immediately.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Salad Niçoise (pronounced nee-suaz) is essentially a French composed salad, much like our American Cobb salad, but with tuna, green beans, and potatoes, instead of chicken, bacon, and avocado. Salad Niçoise hails from Nice, on the Mediterranean Sea, though like so many foods we enjoy here of French origin, has changed a bit to adapt to our tastes. According to the Wikipedia the Niçoise salads are always made with raw vegetables and served with anchovies. Nicoise salads that are served in America are typically served on a bed of lettuce and include cooked green beans and potatoes. According to our Paris insider, the Niçoise salads there are all made with canned tuna. Depending on the establishment here, I’ve had them either with canned or with freshly grilled tuna. Like its American Cobb salad cousin, the Salad Nicoise takes some time to prepare, given all of the ingredients. This is one dish where setting up your mise en place (all ingredients chopped and ready to go) will help the salad come together smoothly.\n
829	Pumpkin Soup with Smoked Paprika	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKabocha pumpkins. If you use a Kabocha, note they are pretty hard, use a strong, sturdy knife and be careful when you cut the pumpkin.\n1 To make pumpkin purée, cut a sugar or Kabocha pumpkin in half, scoop out the seeds* and stringy stuff (an ice cream scoop works well for this purpose), lie face down on a foil or Silpat lined baking sheet. Bake at 350°F until soft, about 45 min to an hour. Cool, scoop out the flesh. Freeze whatever you don't use for future use.\n* Don't throw away the seeds! Use them to make toasted pumpkin seeds.\n\n2 Melt butter in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add smoked paprika, cayenne, and cumin and stir for a minute more.\n3 Add chopped apple and pumpkin purée. Add broth, water. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Season with a little salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer for 20 minutes or until the apples are cooked through.\n4 Working in batches, transfer soup to a blender or a food processor. Cover tightly and blend until smooth. If you want extra smooth soup, pass the purée through a food mill, after it's been through the blender. Return the soup to the saucepan.\n5 With soup on low heat, slowly add the milk and cream, stirring to incorporate. Add salt to taste. Adjust other seasonings to taste.\nCan make a day ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever tried cooking with smoked paprika? A few months ago I posted a recipe for roasted chicken with smoked paprika in which I told how I first encountered smoked paprika in a kumara soup in New Zealand. Like chipotle, smoked paprika can add a wonderful smokey dimension to food. It’s perfect with this rich and creamy pumpkin soup. McCormick is finally putting some marketing effort behind promoting this wonderful spice, so you should be able to find it easily in your local supermarket.\n
830	Poppy Seed Kolache	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large mixing bowl combine 2 cups of the flour, the yeast, and nutmeg or mace; set aside.\n\n2  In a medium saucepan heat and stir the 1 cup milk, the 1/2 cup butter, the granulated sugar, and salt just until warm (120 degree F to 130 degree F) and butter almost melts. Add milk mixture to dry mixture along with the two eggs and vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping side of bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Stir in lemon zest and as much of the remaining flour as you can.\n\n3 Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total). Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the surface. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double in size (for 1 to 1-1/2 hours).\n\n4 If you are making the poppy seed filling from scratch, combine the filling ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook over low heat until it thickens, stirring often. Set filling aside to cool.\n\n5  Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Grease 2 baking sheets.\n\n\n\n6 Roll each dough half into a 16x8 inch rectangle, about an 1/8 inch thick.  Cut each rectangle into 8 4x4 squares.  Place a large, heaping tablespoon of poppy seed filling onto the center of each square.  If you want, add a few raisins to the top of the filling.  Brush the four corners of each square with water.  Draw the corners up and gently press together.  Secure with a toothpick. Place on well greased baking sheets, 2 inches apart.  Cover; let rise in a warm place until nearly double (about 35 minutes).\n\n\n\n7 Brush with an egg wash made with one egg beaten with a tablespoon of milk. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden. Transfer to wire racks; cool completely. Remove toothpicks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father gets a faraway look in his eyes when he remembers his Minnesota Czech grandmother’s poppy seed pastries. Called “kolache” (koh-LAH-chee), “kolacky” (koh-LAH-kee), or how my dad pronounces it, koh-LAH-chkey, these Czechoslovakian yeast-based pastries can be filled with any sweet pie or pastry filling. Dad loves poppy seed filling, and armed with an old Better Homes and Gardens recipe, he set out to recreate the kolaches of his childhood. I think he was successful (after quadrupling the filling to dough ratio in the recipe), so much so that the day after making and eating these, he announced that he had gained 2 pounds, prompting him to give up dessert for two whole days. (Please God, in my next life, could I have my father’s metabolism?)\n \nMy father makes these kolaches with canned poppy seed filling. If you want, you can make the filling from scratch; I’ve included a filling recipe that I found online.\n
831	Spicy Garlic Shrimp with Coconut Rice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Start cooking rice, following package instructions.\n\n2 Pulse garlic, water and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, just a few pulses, so you can still see chunks of garlic. Pour over shrimp to marinate. Marinate for 10 minutes.\n\n3 Strain the water from the shrimp and garlic mixture. Add the lime juice (or finely sliced lemongrass), jalapeño, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the shrimp mixture.\n\n4 Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in high heat in large sauté pan. Add shrimp. Cook one minute. Add 1 small can of coconut milk. Cook 30 seconds more. Mix in a teaspoon red chili powder or sauce.\n5 Put rice into a large bowl. Mix in the second 5.6 ounce can of coconut milk to the cooked rice.\nServe shrimp on rice. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro (optional).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Throughout the coastal areas of Latin America, you’ll find local variations of “Camarones al Ajillo”, freshly caught shrimp, fried quickly in olive oil with garlic and chiles. My friend Arturo grew up near the beaches of Acapulco and learned a way of preparing the garlic shrimp classic with jalapenos and coconut milk. The layers of flavor in this dish are fabulous – chile, shrimp, coconut, lemon grass (or lime). If you get the timing right, this dish cooks up quite fast. You can use either peeled or unpeeled shrimp. The peeled is easier to eat, but the unpeeled absorbs flavor from the shells while cooking.\n
832	Homemade Grape Juice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1. Pick the grapes. Get a large basket, wear long sleaves and a hat, bring clippers, and fill up the basket with grape bunches. Keep in mind that a pound of grapes will yield a little less than a cup of juice.\n\n2. Wash and de-stem the grapes. Put grapes in a basin filled with water. Then rinse the individual grapes, picking them away from the stem, collecting the grapes in a large bowl, and discarding the green unripe and old shriveled grapes.\n\n3. Mash the grapes. With a potato masher, mash away at the grapes so the juice begins to flow. If you have picked a lot of grapes, you may need to work in batches. We have found it easiest to mash about 4 lbs of grapes at a time.\n4. Cook the grapes. Put the mashed grapes into a large stockpot. Slowly heat the grapes and juice to a simmer on medium heat and then simmer for 10 minutes. Stir occasionally so that the grapes don't stick to the bottom of the pan. Halfway through cooking mash some more, breaking up as many of the remaining grapes as possible.\n5. Prepare sieve or cheesecloth. Get another large pot, place a large fine mesh sieve over it. Alternatively you can cover it with two layers of cheesecloth, secure with a rubber band. Make sure pot is sitting on a plate to catch any juice that may run over.\n\n\n6. Strain grape mixture. Ladle grape mixture over sieve or cheesecloth to strain. Let sit for several hours or overnight in the refrigerator to strain completely.\n7. Finishing. Remove sieve or cheesecloth.* Note that sediment will have formed on the bottom of the container. Rinse out the sieve or cheesecloth and strain the juice again, to filter out some of the sediment. Pour or ladle juice into containers. Enjoy your juice!\n* Note that the grape mash can be composted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Late September and early October is Concord Grape season in California’s central valley. Every time I walk under our grape arbor in this season, just the smell of those ripe grapes conjures up memories of childhood – wolfing down a PB & J, slurping a rapidly melting frozen grape juice bar (mom was way more into those than neon popsicles), or greedily munching on a grape flavored jelly bean, lifesaver, or any of those turn-your-mouth-purple candies that we loved. We used to make Grape juice from Welch’s frozen concentrate; sometimes the lid didn’t come off so easily and splat there went a purple goopy mess all over our shirts.\nIf you have never had fresh, homemade grape juice, I assure you, you are missing out; it’s nothing like anything you can buy in a store. It’s more like nectar than store bought juice, thick and smooth. We like to dilute ours a bit with sparkling water. Over the years we’ve learned that our homemade grape juice doesn’t really freeze well; it just doesn’t taste nearly as special upon defrosting. So when it’s in season, we drink it up.\nThis recipe uses Concord grapes which, according to my friends in Concord, Mass, still grow wild around those parts. I’m pretty sure you could use this grape juice recipe with any kind of sweet grape you like.\n
833	Roasted New Potatoes with Caramelized Onions and Truffle Oil	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Put onions and potatoes in a sturdy roasting pan.  Pour olive oil over them and toss well to coat.  Liberally sprinkle salt and pepper over the potatoes and onions.  Spread the potatoes out so they are in a single layer in the pan.  Place in oven.  Cook for 40 minutes or until the potatoes are lightly browned and cooked through.\n\n2 Place potatoes and onions in a serving dish.  Sprinkle well with truffle oil.  Toss to coat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Perfume makers should give up on chasing pheromones and start trying to mimic the scent of truffles instead, the aroma is so irresistible. Have you ever used truffle oil in your cooking? I think I have a new best friend in the kitchen. I don’t want roasted potatoes any other way than tossed with a bit of truffle oil. Yes it is expensive, $12 or more for a little 3 ounce bottle. (Found my bottle at Whole Foods.) But you don’t need much; the amount of truffle oil required for this recipe will cost you anywhere from 25 to 50 cents. Small price to pay to see everyone’s eyes light up with delight as they take their first bite. Truffle oil is especially good with potatoes as the starchy potatoes just soak up the truffle flavor from the oil. These are just basic roasted new potatoes and onions, easy to make, hard to mess up, but they taste out of this world with a few drops of truffle oil.\n
835	Chicken Bacon Roulades	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Working in batches, cook the bacon over medium heat in an ovenproof heavy skillet, until lightly brown but still flexible (not crisp). Place the bacon on paper towels to drain. Cook the shallots in the remaining bacon fat over low heat, stirring, until softened. Transfer shallots with a slotted spoon to a small bowl and leave any fat remaining in skillet. Preheat oven to 300°F.\n\n2 Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With smooth side of a meat pounder pound each breast to 1/8-inch thickness. Discard plastic from boned side of each breast. Sprinkle chicken with lemon pepper (or ground black pepper and a little lemon zest) and salt. Place 2 1/2 slices of bacon lengthwise (parallel with grain of flesh) along middle of each breast. Top with shallots and Parmesan. Using plastic wrap to help you, tightly roll up each breast lengthwise, tucking in the ends to enclose the filling. Secure seams with wooden toothpicks.\n\n3 Add 1 Tbsp olive oil to reserved fat in skillet and heat over medium high heat. Brown roulades on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the skillet to middle of oven and bake roulades until just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. (Note: we found that our skillet didn't fit in our oven, so we transfered the roulades to a smaller pan.)\n\n4 Transfer chicken to a plate with tongs and keep warm, covered with aluminum foil. Pour off fat from skillet. (Careful! The handle is hot, use an oven mitt.) Add wine to the skillet and deglaze over medium high heat, scraping up brown bits. Boil wine until reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Add garlic and butter. Cook mixture over medium low heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add flour and cook roux, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth and cream and bring to a boil, whisking. Simmer the sauce, whisking, 2 minutes. Pour through a fine mesh sieve into a small saucepan. Keep sauce warm. Remove the wooden toothpicks from roulades and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Spoon some sauce in center of each of 4 plates and arrange roulade slices decoratively on sauce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Chicken breasts, pounded thin, stuffed with bacon, shallots, and Parmesan, rolled up, browned, roasted, then served sliced, with a creamy white sauce. Yowza.\nThis meal, a veritable feast, is dedicated to Simply Recipes frequent commenter jonathan who knows that if we could make bacon ice cream we would, just for him. Update: David Lebovitz beat us to it.\n
836	Avocado Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArrange slices of avocado and tomato on a plate.  Sprinkle with chives, lemon juice, and coarse salt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Mark Bittman of the New York Times recently did a write up of simple meals ready in 10 minutes or less. This avocado tomato salad would be my entry, but in five minutes or less, and that would include picking the chives and tomato from the garden.\nAll one really needs to dress an avocado is a little bit of lemon juice. No need for oil, there’s enough of it in the avocado. If you’re in a real hurry, just remove the pit from one half of an avocado still in its skin, squeeze in some lemon juice, and eat it up with a spoon. But with this beautiful heirloom tomato just looking for an excuse to be eaten, it takes all of one minute more to slice and arrange both. Fleur de sel sea salt is lovely on the tomatoes and avocado. Balsamic works as well, but lemon juice does a better job at accenting the simple flavor of the avocado.\n
838	White Beans and Sausage	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse the beans under cold running water. Remove any stones you may find. Place the beans in a large pot and cover with at least a couple of inches with cold water.  Soak for at least 4 hours. (To do a quick soak, you can pour boiling water over the beans and cover by a couple of inches, and just soak for one hour instead of four.)\n\n2 Drain the beans.  Add 3 quarts of water back to the beans in the pot.  Add 2 Tbsp olive oil, the sage leaves, 2 cloves crushed garlic, and the peppercorns.  Cover, bring to a simmer on medium heat, and simmer beans for one hour.  Season to taste with salt.  Lower the heat so that the beans are barely simmering.  Cook for an additional 1-2 hours, or until beans are just tender.  Note that the fresher the beans the shorter the cooking time, the older the beans the longer the cooking time.  Remove from heat and let cool in cooking liquid.  Set aside 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, drain the rest from the beans.\n\n3 Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat.  Remove sausages from their casings (if the sausage has come in casings), and fry on the skillet until lightly browned, about 3-4 minutes.  Do not stir that much and do not crowd the pan, or the sausage won't brown well.  Add the reserved bean cooking liquid, 4 Tbsp olive oil, garlic, chopped tomatoes, and red pepper flakes, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n4 Add the reserved beans and tomato purée.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer a few minutes longer, stirring gently, until sausage is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.  Be careful not to break up the beans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Okay, so why didn’t we think of this earlier? White beans, Italian sausage, tomato sauce. It’s sort of like spaghetti but with white beans instead of pasta. Filling? Yes. Resistible? No.\n
839	Coleslaw	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Starting with a head or half a head of cabbage, thinly slice the cabbage until you have approximately 4 cups (not packed) of sliced cabbage.  (Using a mandoline helps in this case.)  Julienne a half of a carrot.  Thinly slice a couple green onions.\n\n1 For the mayo dressing version, add 3 Tbsp mayo, 1/2 teaspoon of yellow mustard and mix in with the cabbage, carrot, and onions.  Add pepper to taste.\n\n3 For the non-mayo version, add a couple tablespoons of rice vinegar.  Sprinkle with sugar, salt, and pepper to taste.\n\nServe immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The word “coleslaw” comes from the Dutch word, “koolsla”, “kool” meaning cabbage and sla, salad. The word entered our English language from the Dutch in New York in the late 1700s. Since then it has been a featured side dish at almost every picnic or barbecue in America. We have coleslaw at least once a week, usually with fish, and often with burgers or hot dogs. Our ways of preparing it are ridiculously simple, one with a mayonnaise dressing, the other with rice vinegar and a big of sugar. Sometimes we add some shredded green apple to the mix. Are you a coleslaw eater? If so, what’s your favorite way of preparing it?\n
840	Spicy Fig Orange Microwave Jam	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Place the ingredients in a large ceramic or glass bowl or casserole (we use a 2-quart pyrex measuring cup), stir to combine, let sit for 30 minutes for the fruit to macerate in the sugar.\n\n2 Place in microwave. You will cook the fruit mixture on the high setting for approximately 15 minutes. As soon as the mixture starts to boil, after about 6 to 8 minutes, stop the cooking and stir. Continue cooking and stir every few minutes. At about 13 minutes the mixture should start to get viscous. If you spoon out a bit on to a small plate that has been in the freezer, you can push the mixture around a bit with your finger tip to see how thick it is. If it is runny, cook it a couple minutes more. You can also check by seeing how the jam runs off of a spoon. If it seems to firm up a bit as it drips, it's done.\nIf you use a large pyrex measuring cup as we have done here, you can see that you start with close to 3 cups of liquid. You want to boil it down to 2 cups.\n\n3 Pour out the jam into jars, leaving 1/4-inch of headroom from the top of the jars. If you want to keep your jam in a cupboard, then use sterilized jars (heat them in the oven at 200°F for 10 minutes). If you plan to eat up quickly and will keep them in the refrigerator, regular clean jars will do.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Late summer is a busy season at my parent’s house. The apple trees are loaded with apples and the fig tree has my mother scrambling to find people who like figs. If it’s fig season and you’re meeting my mother for the first time, right after “nice to meet you” you’ll hear, “do you like figs?” with a look of hopeful anticipation. Mom can never find enough neighbors, friends, ladies at the exercise class to give figs to so she dries and freezes some, and with others makes a wonderful fig microwave jam.\nMicrowave jam, what’s that? That, my friends, is the way my mother makes jams. She learned this technique 30 years ago from Sunset Magazine and never looked back. Now that I’ve finally tried her approach, I can see the appeal. You make only small batches – a pint at a time – enough for your own use in most cases, and it takes all of 15 minutes of cooking time. Since we make only 2 small jars and we use them up quickly, there’s no need to sterilize the jars, just use clean jars that have been rinsed, and put the jam in refrigerator after it has set.\nThis spicy, orange-y fig jam is a cinch to make. We used mild green figs because we grow them, but you could easily use the darker Mission figs. The jam is a wonderful dipping sauce for nutty cheeses such as Gruyere.\n
841	Apple Cobbler	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Filling directions:  Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat.  Stir in apple slices, lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar and flour.  Cover partially and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir in vanilla.  Transfer to buttered 10" pie dish.  (This recipe has the crust only on the top).\n\n\n\n2 Crust directions: In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Stir in ginger.  Stir orange zest into cream; then, using a fork, stir cream into flour until the doug holds together.  Gather dough into a ball; knead briefly then roll out to a little larger than pie dish.  Transfer to dish; trim off excess.  Score the center so the steam can escape while baking.  Brush with cream.\n\n\n\n3 Bake 10 minutes in a 450ºF (230°C) oven.  Reduce heat to 375ºF (190°C) and bake 20-25 minutes.  Serve warm with whipped cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	For years, this apple cobbler recipe has been one of my father’s “signature” apple dishes (knowing my dad, bemused by the thought of his having a “signature” anything, he would probably agree to this statement with dramatic flourish and an affected British accent – “Oh yus, indeed, one of my signatcha dishes”). The cobbler usually starts showing up on the family menu at the end of August, beginning of September, when the great-for-baking, tart Granny Smith apples begin falling off the tree. The cobbler is packed with slices of green apples, seasoned with cinnamon, lemon juice, and vanilla, and topped with a thick biscuit-y crust, with a touch of ginger and orange peel. \n
842	Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Put the mint leaves in a heavy saucepan with the 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of the cream. Heat until just steaming (do not let boil), remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 30 minutes.   Reheat the mixture until steaming, remove from heat and let stand for 15 more minutes.\n\n2 While the mint is infusing in step 1, prepare the remaining cream over an ice bath.  Pour the remaining 1 cup of cream into a medium size metal bowl, set in ice water (with lots of ice) over a larger bowl. Set a mesh strainer on top of the bowls. Set aside.\n\n3 Strain the milk cream mixture into a separate bowl, pressing against the mint leaves with a rubber spatula in the sieve to get the most liquid out of them.  Return the milk cream mixture to the saucepan.   Add sugar and salt to the mixture. Heat until just steaming again, stirring until sugar has dissolved.  Remove from heat.\n\n4 Whisk the egg yolks in a medium sized bowl.  Slowly pour the heated milk cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm mixture, but not cooked by it.  Scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.\n\n5 Return the saucepan to the stove, stirring the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run. This can take about 10 minutes.\n\nThe custard base does not coat the back of the spoon, it is not ready.\n\nThe custard base coats the back of the spoon.  You can run your finger across the coating and have it not run.  It is ready and should be removed from heat immediately, and poured through the sieve over the ice bath to stop the cooking.\n\n6 Pour the custard through the strainer (from step 2) and stir into the cold cream to stop the cooking.\n\n7 Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator (at least a couple of hours) or stir the mixture in the bowl placed over the ice bath until thoroughly chilled (20 minutes or so).  Freeze the mixture in  your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n8 Once the ice cream has been made in the ice cream maker it should be pretty soft.  Gently fold in the finely chopped chocolate.  Put in an airtight container and place in the freezer for at least an hour, preferably several hours.  If it has been frozen for more than a day, you may need to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften it before serving.  \n\nNote that there is no alcohol in this recipe.  A few teaspoons of some spirits such as rum or bourbon will help keep the ice cream soft over several days.  Even the alcohol in vanilla extract will help.  If you have no added alcohol in a homemade ice cream recipe, we recommend that you eat it up quickly, in a day or two; beyond that point the ice cream will quickly get very very hard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“This is the best mint chocolate chip ice cream I’ve ever had in my whole life.” This, straight from the mouth of my nine-year old nephew, who, since mint-chocolate-chip is his favorite ice cream flavor, has probably had more mint chocolate chip ice cream in the last year than any of us have had in the last twenty. Needless to say, hearing such a declaration when you’ve gone the extra effort to make ice cream from scratch is rather gratifying, don’t you think?\nWe have a couple of mint patches growing in our yard, though I never thought to use the mint we grow for ice cream until now. The taste of the ice cream using fresh mint really is out of this world, so if you can get your hands on fresh mint, I highly recommend using it for this ice cream.\n
855	Pumpkin Biscotti	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Sift together the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, and spices into a large bowl.\n2 In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, pumpkin purée, and vanilla extract. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the flour mixture. Give it a rough stir to generally incorporate the ingredients, the dough will be crumbly.\n3 Flour your hands and a clean kitchen surface and lightly knead the dough. Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper. Form the dough into a large log, roughly about 15-20 inches by 6-7 inches. The loaves should be relatively flat, only about 1/2 inch high. Bake for 22-30 minutes at 350 F, until the center is firm to the touch. (Feel free to also form two smaller logs for cute two-bite biscotti; just cut the baking time to 18-24 minutes.)\n4 Let biscotti cool for 15 minutes and then using a serrated knife cut into 1 inch wide pieces. Turn the oven to 300 F and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes. Cool completely.\nBiscotti may be still a tad moist and chewy, so if you prefer it crisp let it sit uncovered overnight in a dry space. Serve and enjoy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Garrett McCord who is kicking off a series of cookie recipes as a guest author on Simply Recipes. ~Elise\nIt’s early fall here in Sacramento, and outside the proof is irrefutable. Low grey clouds crawl across the sky and with them brings chilly winds that shiver the leaves right off their branches. It’s the kind of weather where pulling down an extra blanket and sitting on the couch with a warm cup of chai or espresso, and a plate of crunchy biscotti is the only sensible thing to do.\nBiscotti have become quite popular as a coffee house cookie. Flavorful, crunchy, and meant for dipping, they’re cookies that every home cook should have a recipe for in my opinion. With fall around the corner these pumpkin biscotti with hints of warm winter spices just seem so appropriate. They’re warming, rustic, and not too sweet. Plus, baking these will fill your home with an aroma reminiscent of pumpkin pie.\n\nThis recipe is adaptable and welcomes the addition of toasted pecans or dried cranberries. I sometimes like adding a bit of chopped white or dark chocolate as well, if I feel like spoiling myself just a little.\n
843	Chicken Marsala with Pancetta and Cream	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Coat a large skillet lightly with olive oil and set it over medium high heat.  Add the pancetta and cook until just crip and lightly browned.  Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside.  Add the onions to the pan and cook until translucent and slightly browned, 5-10 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside.\n\n2 Put the flour on a plate.  Pat the cutlets dry.  Season them on both sides lightly with salt and amply with pepper.  Heat the skillet with the pancetta fat over medium high.  Add more olive oil, if needed, to get about 2 Tbsp of fat in the pan.\n\n\n\n3 When the fat is hot, dredge a cutlet through the flour on both sides.  Shake off the excess flour and immediately put the cutlet in the pan.  Do the same with as many cutlets as will fit in the pan without touching.  Sauté the cutlets, turning once, until browned on both sides.  If thin, they should cook through in just a few minutes total.  Transfer the cooked cutlets to a plate and continue sauteíng the rest, adding more oil if necessary.  Transfer these to the plate as well.\n\n\n\n4 Pour off the excess fat.  With the pan over med-high heat, add the Marsala and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.   Cook until the Marsala is reduced by about a quarter.  Stir in the cream and boil until you get a nicely thickened sauce.  \nReturn the chicken, onions, and pancetta to the pan and turn the cutlets over to coat.  Let them reheat for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Serve with the sauce and a sprinkling of parsley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Chicken marsala is one of those Italian American dishes that seems to be a standard in many a home cook’s repertoire. It consists of flour-coated thin chicken breast cutlets, cooked with a Marsala wine reduction and usually mushrooms as well. This recipe for chicken marsala is one of my father’s favorites. It doesn’t use mushrooms, though you could certainly include them, and gets much of its flavor from pancetta, an Italian version of bacon, that is salt-cured not smoked. It takes all of maybe 30 minutes to prepare, so it’s perfect for a midweek dinner. Dad sometimes substitutes bacon for the pancetta (gasp!); according to him, “one can’t live on pancetta alone.” And he sometimes switches out the Marsala for dry vermouth.\n
844	Membrillo (Quince Paste)	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Place quince pieces in a large saucepan (6-8 quarts) and cover with water.  Add the vanilla pod and lemon peel and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer, cover, and let cook until the quince pieces are fork tender (30-40 minutes). \n\n\n\n2 Strain the water from the quince pieces.  Discard the vanilla pod but keep the lemon peel with the quince.  Purée the quince pieces in a food processor, blender, or by using a food mill.  Measure the quince purée.  Whatever amount of quince purée you have, that's how much sugar you will need.  So if you have 4 cups of purée, you'll need 4 cups of sugar.  Return the quince purée to the large pan.  Heat to medium-low.  Add the sugar.  Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar has completely dissolved.  Add the lemon juice.\n\n\n\n3 Continue to cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1-1 1/2 hours,  until the quince paste is very thick and has a deep orange pink color.\n\n\n\n4 Preheat oven to a low 125°F (52°C).  Line a 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper (do not use wax paper, it will melt!).  Grease the parchment paper with a thin coating of butter.  Pour the cooked quince paste into the parchment paper-lined baking pan.  Smooth out the top of the paste so it is even.  Place in the oven for about an hour to help it dry.  Remove from oven and let cool.\n\nTo serve, cut into squares or wedges and present with Manchego cheese.  To eat, take a small slice of the membrillo and spread it on top of a slice of the cheese.  Store by wrapping in foil or plastic wrap, an keeping in the refrigerator.\n\nNote:  The first time I made this the top part set, but the bottom had not.  To fix, I emptied the quince paste into a large pyrex bowl and put in the microwave.  I cooked it on high in 5 minute increments for 20 minutes.  During the last minute one of the edges started to caramelize and turn brown.  This you don't want to have happen, as the caramelized parts destroy the flavor,  but in this case it was a good indication that the rest of the quince paste was ready.  I discarded the browned parts and returned the rest to a newly lined baking dish.  Back into the oven for an hour and it was done to perfection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Ever since I started making quince jelly people have been telling me about membrillo, a quince paste that is practically the national snack of Spain when paired with Manchego, sheep’s milk cheese. Nicky and Melissa have written about membrillo, enough to inspire me to go to Whole Foods and buy some to try for myself. Oh my gosh. If you have never tried membrillo with Manchego, get yourself to the nearest Whole Foods or other specialty market and buy some. If I lived in Spain I would eat this every day. Once you’ve tried it, you’ll see what all the fuss is about, and you may even be motivated to try your hand at making some, which is exactly what happened to me. \nNot familiar with quince? It’s a hard fruit that looks sort of like a cross between an apple and a pear. Most varieties you can’t eat raw, only cooked. They cook up pink and have a wonderful sweet floral aroma. Like apples and pears, they’re in season during the fall. \n
845	Caramel Corn	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat oven to 225°F. Place popcorn in large roasting pan; set aside.\n\n\n\n2 Combine brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, molasses and salt in a thick-bottomed, 2-quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a full boil. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until candy thermometer reaches 250°F or small amount of mixture dropped in ice water forms a hard ball (about 12 to 14 minutes). Remove from heat; stir in baking soda.  The caramel will foam up a little and turn a lighter color when you add the baking soda.\n\n\n\n3 Carefully pour hot mixture over the popcorn in a large roasting pan. (If you would like peanuts with your popcorn, sprinkle the salted peanuts over the caramel sauce at this point.)  Using a wooden spoon, stir until all popcorn is coated. (Be  careful not to let the caramel touch you; it's very hot.)  Place in oven for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven, stir to more evenly coat the popcorn with the caramel sauce.  Return to oven. Continue cooking for 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Immediately spread caramel corn out onto waxed paper.  Let cool completely. Break into bite-sized pieces. Store in tightly covered container. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The memory has faded some, but the feeling of pure joy is as strong as ever – dad coming home and pulling out from behind his back, to the raucous squeals of us kids, boxes of Cracker Jack, caramel corn that rattled when you shook the box. (Remember those commercials?) We had to have our own box, couldn’t possibly share, because each box had a surprise gift and we each had to have our own gift. (Is that brilliant marketing or what?) No wonder I love caramel corn.\n
846	Monster Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Beat the butter and peanut butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugars and beat at medium speed until well incorporated and fluffy. \n\n2  Add the eggs and vanilla and beat for about 2 minutes on medium speed.\n\n3  Add the baking soda and beat for 30 seconds. Be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom to ensure all the butter is well incorporated. \n\n4  Add the flour and salt, a bit at a time until incorporated but do not overmix.\n\n5 Fold in the mix-ins for either the kid version or the adult version. OR split the dough in half and cut the mix-in ingredient measurements in half, for half adult cookies and half kid cookies. \n\n6 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop on rounded spoonfuls of dough and bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly golden bown. Be sure to let them cool on the baking sheet before you move them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Elise’s neighbor Andrew enjoys one of Garrett’s monster cookies.\nMonster cookies. Ultimate Chippers. Super Cookies. Regardless what you call them, kids love them. A cookie packed full of peanut butter, chocolate, and candy, it’s a must have cookie for Halloween and perfect for any kid oriented event.\nStill, adults shouldn’t miss out and personally, I’m not the biggest peanut butter and candy fan (insert collective gasp). So while making this classic kiddy cookie, I decided to make a few tweaks for an adult version of The Monster. Studded with Heath toffee bar chips, dark chocolate, and pecans it’s a very sophisticated sugar rush. I also made a version that didn’t use peanut butter to make sure everyone’s happy, including those who aren’t so inclined to the stuff. \n \nPersonally I like to split the base dough into two parts; one half using kids mix-ins and the other using adult mix-ins. If you decide to split the dough into two different batches, halve the amount of the mix-ins, otherwise it will be all candy and no cookie. Of course feel free to add white chocolate, almonds, coconut or whatever you most enjoy, that way everybody wins.\n
852	Pumpkin Ginger Nut Muffins	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. In a medium sized bowl, sift together the flour, salt, sugar, and baking soda.\n\n2 Mix the pumpkin, melted butter, eggs, 1/4 cup of water, and spices together, then combine with the dry ingredients, until just incorporated.  Do not over-mix. Fold in the candied ginger and chopped nuts.\n\n3 Spoon mixture into a prepared muffin tin. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Check for doneness with a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin. If it comes out clean, it's done. Cool on a rack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What I love about these quick bread pumpkin muffins is that they are so easy to throw together, and so hard to mess up. You can mix everything by hand with a wooden spoon, don’t need an electric mixer. Baking soda and eggs are the leavening agents, so you don’t have to worry about old baking powder that refuses to rise. The one cup of pumpkin purée can come from a can, or from leftover baked squash, any winter squash will do – butternut squash, acorn, pumpkin – they’ll all work. If you don’t like nuts, keep them out. If you like raisins, add them in. The ginger gives the pumpkin a nice spicy kick, but if you don’t like ginger, skip it. This pumpkin muffin recipe is very flexible. Serve freshly baked, warm, and if you really want to be indulgent, with a little butter, once you’ve broken them open.\n
847	Broccoli Stir Fry with Ginger and Sesame	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Toast the sesame seeds by first heating a small, stick-free sauté pan on medium heat. Add the sesame seeds and jiggle the pan so they spread out in a single layer. Let them cook until lightly browned, stirring occasionally, about 3-5 minutes. Do not walk away from them while cooking, as once they start to brown they can easily burn. Once lightly toasted remove from heat and put into a small bowl, set aside.\n2 Mix the stock, soy sauce, and dark sesame oil together in a small bowl, set aside.\n3 Heat 1 Tbsp of peanut (or canola or grapseed) oil in a large, covered sauté pan on medium high heat. Add the broccoli florets, stir to coat the florets with the oil, Sauté for about a minute. Clear a space in the middle of the broccoli and add the ginger and garlic. Add a little more oil to the ginger and garlic (about a teaspoon) and sauté for half a minute, stirring just the garlic and ginger, until fragrant. Then stir the garlic and ginger in with the broccoli.\n4 Add the chicken (or vegetable) stock mixture to the pan. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat and cover. Let cook for 2-3 minutes, until broccoli is still firm, but can be pierced with a fork. Remove from heat. Remove broccoli with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Return pan to heat, increase heat to high and boil down the liquid until just a couple tablespoons remain. Turn off heat, return broccoli to the pan, add the toasted sesame seeds, toss with the liquid. Put into a serving bowl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Some people get chocolate cravings. I get broccoli cravings. Sometimes I think it’s my body’s way of telling me I’ve been laying on the bacon a bit too thick (or maybe the chocolate!) But honestly I could eat broccoli every day of the year and not get tired of it. Here’s a quick and easy recipe for broccoli, stir-fried with a little ginger and sesame. The broccoli florets are quickly stir-fried initially, then steamed in a sauce of stock, sesame oil, and soy sauce. This quick cooking technique works best with the florets. Don’t discard the broccoli stalks, peel them and slice them thick and eat them raw like you would a carrot; the raw stalks are great with dips.\nWhat’s your favorite way of preparing broccoli? Our everyday standby is steamed broccoli but we’re always looking for ideas.\n
848	Cream of Mushroom Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1  In a food processor, coarsely chop mushrooms and lemon juice.\n\n2  Melt butter in (4-5 quart) sauce pan and lightly sauté shallots on medium heat. Add mushrooms, thyme and bay leaf, sauté over moderate heat for 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid that is released from the mushrooms disappears.\n\n\n\n3  Add salt, pepper, cream and chicken stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.\n\n4 Add cornstarch and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.  Correct seasoning and add more lemon juice to taste.  \n\nServe sprinkled with a little parsley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Cream of mushroom soup was the first soup I fell in love with as a child. Of course, back then it was Campbell’s. At age 8 I could make it myself, quickly learning that adding milk tasted a whole lot better than adding water, and that you had to add it slowly, stirring after each addition, to keep it from getting clumpy. Fast forward to grown-up-land and in my mind, there is still nothing better than cream of mushroom soup, though now we make it with chopped mushrooms, homemade chicken stock (if we have some on hand), and rich cream. Many thanks to my college classmate Scott Simon who gave us the following recipe for this delicious soup, and who clearly loves cream of mushroom soup as much as I.\n
849	Amaretti Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 300 F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\n2 In a food processor mill together the almond flour and sugar. Add the vanilla and almond extract and pulse for a few seconds. Add the eggs, one at a time, and continue to process until the dough is smooth. \n\n3  Place teaspoons of the dough on the parchment paper and dust with sugar. Bake for 24-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely before serving. They will be slightly chewy at first, but they will be nicely crispy as a day or two goes by. Store in a cool, dry place.  (Note:  I usually underbake mine since I like them chewy.  If that's your preference, bake them for about 20-24 minutes.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord. ~Elise\nThe first time I had amaretti was in the Piazza San Marco in Venice. I stumbled upon a small cart selling a variety of ornate confections. Yet amongst all the tinsel and colorful sugar my eyes were drawn to a small cellophane bag tied with a small bit of gold ribbon. In it were little pale cookies that looked ordinary but enticing none the less. When opened the bag released a heady perfume that overtook me and those around me. Its sweet almond aroma always takes me back to the Piazza and its surrounding cobbled streets and bridges. \nAmaretti are little cookies that are light as a feather, yet have an intense sweet almond flavor. They’re airy, delicate, and oh so simple to make. The recipe takes no more than 4 minutes to put together and they bake quickly. They taste fantastic on their own, but I’ve also been known to grind them up into a powder and add it to flavor pumpkin bread in lieu of cinnamon and spices, or add them to the batter of vanilla cakes or pancakes to give it depth in flavor. \n
850	Baby Bok Choy with Cashews	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat. Add onions, then garlic, then bok choy. Sprinkle with sesame oil and salt. Cover, and let the baby bok choy cook down for approximately 3 minutes. (Like spinach, when cooked, the bok choy will wilt a bit.)\n2 Remove cover. Lower heat to low. Stir and let cook for a minute or two longer, until the bok choy is just cooked.\n3 Gently mix in cashews.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Sometimes the simplest things are the most enjoyable. My mother whipped up this quick and easy baby bok choy dish the other night. It was so good I made her make it again the next day so I could watch with pad and pen in hand. This is hard on mom actually, as she never makes anything the same way twice, and she never measures (obviously not a baker). I make her weigh things. “How much bok choy is that mom?” She looks at me as if I’ve just asked her how many miles there are to the moon. I get the kitchen scale down from the cabinet. Why cashews? Because that’s what we had on hand. Almonds would work too. If you want you could jazz it up a bit with a little freshly grated ginger and a shake of chili pepper flakes.\n
851	Butternut Squash Risotto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat broth in medium sized saucepan and keep warm over low heat. Melt 4 Tbsp of butter in a large saucepan; add onion and butternut squash. Cook over medium heat until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.\n2 Add rice to onion and squash. Cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine. Cook, stirring constantly until wine has been absorbed by the rice or evaporated. Add a few ladles of broth, just enough to barely cover rice. Cook over medium heat until broth has been absorbed. Continue cooking and stirring rice, adding a little bit of broth at a time, cooking and stirring until it is absorbed, until the rice is tender, but still firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.\n3 During the last minutes of cooking, add remaining tablespoon of butter, 1/3 cup Parmesan, and chives. At this point the rice should have a creamy consistency. Add salt to taste. Serve with remaining grated Parmesan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Our next door neighbor Pat has a wonderfully productive garden where she grows much of her own food. We are the lucky beneficiaries of her overflow in times when, for example, she has harvested 15 large butternut squash and there are still 15 more on the vine. No matter how much Pat loves winter squash, even she knows that she can’t eat all thirty of them by herself. Yikes! Here’s a lovely risotto we made recently with about half of one butternut squash that Pat brought over. (The other half went into pumpkin bread.) The risotto is so simple, with arborio rice, squash, broth, onions, white wine, and Parmesan; it just takes a bit of attention (stirring) while the rice slowly absorbs the broth.\n
856	Apple Cranberry Stuffed Pork Roast	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Before starting on the pork, put the pork roast in the freezer for 30 minutes to make it easier to cut.  While the pork is chilling, you can make the filling.\n\n2 Bring all the filling ingredients to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until apples are very soft, about 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, reserving the liquid.  Use a rubber spatula to press against the apple mixture in the sieve to extract as much liquid out as possible.  Return liquid to saucepan and simmer over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat, set aside and reserve this liquid for use as a glaze. Pulse apple mixture in food processor, about fifteen 1-second pulses. Set aside.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°F or prepare your grill for indirect heat.  You will be "double-butterflying" the pork roast.  Lay the roast down, fat side up.  Insert the knife into the roast 1/2-inch horizontally from the bottom of the roast, along the long side of the roast.  Make a  long cut along the bottom of the roast, stopping 1/2 inch before the edge of the roast.  You might find it easier to handle by starting at a corner of the roast.\n\n\n\nOpen up the roast and continue to cut through the thicker half of the roast, again keeping 1/2 inch from the bottom.  Repeat until the roast is an even 1/2-inch thickness all over when laid out.\n\n\n\nIf necessary, pound the roast to an even thickness with a meat pounder.\n\n\n\n3 Season the inside of the roast well with salt and pepper.  Spread out the filling on the roast, leaving a 1/2-inch border from the edges.  Starting with the short side of the roast, roll it up very tightly.  Secure with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals.  Season the outside of the roast generously with salt and pepper.\n\n4 Place roast on a rack in a roasting pan, place in oven, on the middle rack.  \n\nYou can also grill the roast, using indirect heat either gas or charcoal.  If you are using charcoal, use about 5 pounds of coals, bank them to one side.  Preheat the grill, covered.  Wipe the grates with olive oil.  Place roast, fat side up, on the side of the grill that has no coals underneath.  Place the lid on the grill, with the vent directly over the roast.  If you are grilling with gas, place all the burners on high for 15 minutes to heat the grates, brush grates with olive oil, turn off the middle burner, place roast fat-side up on middle burner.  If you are grilling, turn roast half way through the cooking.\n\nCook for 45 to 60 minutes, until the internal temperature of the roast is 130 to 135 degrees.  Brush with half of the glaze and cook for 5 minutes longer.  Remove the roast from the oven or grill.  Place it on a cutting board.  Tent it with foil to rest and keep warm for 15 minutes before slicing.\n\n\n\n5 Slice into 1/2-inch wide pieces, removing the cooking twine as you cut the roast.  Serve with remaining glaze.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Are you familiar with Cook’s Illustrated? It’s a magazine and a website from the same people who create the PBS show America’s Test Kitchen. It’s the only cooking show we watch with any regularity, and we read each issue of the magazine from cover to cover. What I love about the magazine is that they go into great deal of detail about the how’s and why’s of various cooking methods; I always learn something new. (What I don’t love about the magazine is that they tend to overcomplicate things, just for that n-th degree of perfection.)\nThis apple cranberry stuffed pork roast recipe is based on a recipe from Cook’s Illustrated (Sept 07). We absolutely loved it; I’ve been eating the leftovers for days. The filling is essentially a sweet sour chutney, made with brown sugar, vinegar, dried apples and cranberries. Though pretty much any chutney would work in this recipe. The roast is “double butterflied”, filling applied, meat rolled up and roasted. The acidity of the chutney-ish filling tenderizes the pork roast from the inside. The original recipe calls for grilling the roast with soaked wood chips but you can easily make this roast in the oven. The recipe also uses dried apples, which can be a little hard to find. I think next time we may try making this with peeled, diced, fresh apples.\n
857	Sauerkraut with Bacon and Apples	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put bacon in a large, high-sided oven-proof sauté pan with a lid and place over medium heat.  Cook for about 5 minutes, or until most of the fat has been rendered out, turning as needed.  Drain excess fat from pan (leave in about a tablespoon).  Remove bacon from the pan and let cool on a plate lined with a paper towel.  Roughly chop the bacon and set aside.\n\n2 Add the apples, onion, garlic, and caraway and decrease the heat to low.  Cover partially and cook for 10 minutes, until the onion is tender.\n\n3 Remove the lid, stir in the apple cider and vinegar, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil.  Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to a thick, syrupy consistency.  \n\n4 Reduce the heat to low.  Stir in the sauerkraut and bacon, cover, and cook 10 minutes, or until sauerkraut is heated through and tender.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	All this talk of the sweet goodness you can make apples this season, and as someone rightly pointed out to me, there are many savory things you can make with apples as well. My dear Minnesota-raised father, who cannot resist any recipe with both sauerkraut and bacon, couldn’t wait to try this apple and bacon sauerkraut from the Niman Ranch Cookbook. The trick is to use good quality sauerkraut; the best stuff, according to dad, is refrigerated and in a jar. He drains it, but doesn’t rinse it, lest the flavor rinses away. A good quality apple-wood smoked bacon helps too. If you love sauerkraut as much as we do (and there are fewer and fewer of us out there these days, unfortunately), you’ll love this recipe.\n
858	Almond Crescent Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cream the butter and the sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the extracts and mix.\n\n2 Add the flour and almond flour. Mix thoroughly. \n\n3 Take generous tablespoons of the dough (it will be slightly crumbly) and roll it into a small ball, about an inch in diameter, and then shape into a crescent shape. Place onto parchment paper and bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes or until a light golden brown. \n\n4 Dust with powdered sugar.\n\nFor added decadence let the cookies cool and dip one end of them into some melted chocolate, then let the chocolate harden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This week’s Christmas cookie is presented to you by guest author Garrett McCord. ~Elise\nWhen I was a child my parents hated me enough to put me into a table manners class called Ms. Etiquette. I learned to say please and thank you, how to identify nine types of forks, and all of it culminated in a High Tea final exam. The tea party was boring as heck, but there were these delicious little almond crescent cookies. \nAlmond crescents are a very basic tea cookie recipe. They’re very buttery with a pronounced almond flavor. Matched with a cup of Earl Grey or Almond Rocker they’re a great excuse to call over friends on a rainy day for a small tea party of your own.\n
859	Cranberry Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Either grind cranberries and apple together in a grinder, or pulse in a food processor until coarsely shredded, around 10 short pulses.\n\n2 Combine shredded cranberries, orange zest, chile, and sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit 15 minutes for the cranberries to macerate (soften in the sugar). Add cilantro, lime juice, and salt to taste. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Cranberries are only in season for a short time in the fall. Once they appear in the supermarket, fresh in bags, snatch them up while you can. They will last frozen for a few months, but even then, after a few months they will begin to get a bit iffy, so fall really is the time to enjoy whole cranberries. I tried to find frozen cranberries at our local grocer in February with no luck. \nThis is a quick and easy salsa recipe made with fresh cranberries, apples, cilantro, and chilies that is especially good with turkey (see our turkey tacos), but can be used with any dish that calls for fresh salsa.\n
860	Patricia’s Holiday Fruitcake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 325°F.  In a small bowl, mix together the baking soda and sour cream; set aside.\n\n2 Combine the dates, raisins, cherries, and nuts with 1/4 cup of the flour and toss to coat the fruit and nuts.  Set aside.\n\n3 Cream together the butter and sugar.  Mix in the egg, then the orange rind, then the sour cream/baking soda mix.  Add the flour and the salt and mix together.  Combine fruit/nut mixture with creamed ingredients and mix well to distribute the fruit and nuts evenly.\n\n\n\n4 Pour batter into a prepared loaf pan (see note) and bake at 325°F for one and a half to two hours or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.  Place a pan of water in the oven when the cake goes in.  Water may need to be replenished during baking.\n\n5 Wrap tightly with aluminum foil and plastic wrap to store.  If you want, you can sprinkle on a few ounces of Bourbon, especially if you would like to store the fruit cake for a while.\n\nNote:  Line the loaf pan with greased parchment paper or brown baking paper, cut to fit the pan.  Place one piece to run the length of the pan and stand up above the rim about an inch.  Place the other piece or pieces to cover the other sides.  When the cake comes out of the oven, you can easily remove it by holding the sides of the paper and lifting the cake out of the pan.  Once the cake has cooled completely, you can pull off the paper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every year around this time, we anxiously await the arrival of a package from my dad’s friend Fred. What we crave is a loaf of the most wonderful fruitcake, packed with dates, raisins, and glazed cherries, a raisin bread on steroids, made by Fred’s elegant and gifted wife Patricia. As soon as the loaf arrives, dad opens it up from its foil wrapping, pours bourbon on it, wraps it up again, and hides it from the rest of us until Christmas day. He has to hide it or we would be tortured everyday by wanting to eat it and not being allowed to. I’ve never understood some people’s aversion to fruitcake. Maybe it’s a bit like opera, or anchovies, things for which you need to develop an appreciation. Too bad, really, because this fruitcake is terrific, and it would be a shame not to make it just because one had a fruitcake prejudice. \nAfter several years of my begging dad to see if Patricia would be willing to share her recipe, my father finally got the nerve to ask, and she happily offered to it to us. (Thank you Patricia!) To give you an idea of its appeal here, this loaf I baked lasted a day an a half between 3 people. The minute my dad finished the last crumb he made plans to make another loaf the next day. \n
865	Indian Pudding	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Scald the milk and butter in a large double boiler.  Or heat the milk and butter for 5 or 6 minutes on high heat in the microwave, until it is boiling, then transfer it to a pot on the stove.  Keep hot on medium heat.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 250°F.\n\n3  In a separate bowl, mix cornmeal, flour, and salt; stir in molasses.  Thin the mixture with about 1/2 cup of scalded milk, a few tablespoons at a time, then gradually add the mixture back to the large pot of scalded milk.  Cook, stirring until thickened.\n\n4 Temper the eggs by slowly adding a half cup of the hot milk cornmeal mixture to the beaten eggs, whisking constantly.  Add the egg mixture back in with the hot milk cornmeal mixture, stir to combine.  Stir in the sugar and spices, until smooth.  At this point, if the mixture is clumpy, you can run it through a blender to smooth it out.  Stir in the raisins (optional).  Pour into a 2 1/2 quart shallow casserole dish.  Bake for 2 hours at 250°F.  \n\n5 Allow the pudding to cool about an hour to be at its best.  It should be reheated to warm temperature if it has been chilled.  Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My first encounter with Indian Pudding was over 20 years ago at Durgin Park, a landmark restaurant in Faneuil Hall, Boston, famous for its home-style Yankee cooking and, at the time, its cranky, octogenarian waitresses. Few desserts look so completely unappetizing yet taste so incredibly good. One bite of this lumpy, brown mush, with a dab of vanilla ice cream, and I was sold. Scraped every last bit from the bowl. Why indian pudding isn’t more widely known I have no idea; it’s one of my favorite desserts of all time, and a traditional New England Thanksgiving classic. Indian pudding is a baked custard with milk, butter, molasses, eggs, spices, and cornmeal. The name is likely derived from the cornmeal, known as indian meal way back when. Here is a tried-and-true recipe for indian pudding adapted from An Olde Concord Christmas, a long out-of-print book from the Concord Museum.\n
990	Coconut Cupcakes with Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCupcake Method\n1 Preheat the oven to 350 F. Cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add sugar and cream till light and fluffy again, scraping down the sides halfway through to ensure even mixing.\n2 Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 30 seconds each to ensure mixing. Be sure to scrape down the sides after each egg to ensure even mixing.\n3 Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in one bowl. In another add 1 cup of a well shaken can of coconut milk and a teaspoon of vanilla. Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients and mix, then add 1/2 of the wet ingredients. Continue alternating with the wet and dry mixtures, ending with the dry. Stop mixing once just as the ingredients become incorporated; do not overbeat.\n4 Fold in the coconut. Scoop into cupcake papers about one half to three-quarters of the way full. Bake for 18-22 minutes, rotating the pan after the first 15 to ensure even baking. Be sure to check with a toothpick to see if the cupcakes are done. If the toothpick comes out of the cupcake clean, then they're ready. Allow the cupcakes to cool for a minute or two in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nFrosting Method\n1 Cream the butter and cream cheese together, about 3 minutes. Scraped down the sides and bottom.\n2 Slowly add the powdered sugar, taste as you go adding more sugar until you have reached the desired sweetness.\n3 Fold in the coconut. Spread onto cooled cupcakes. Sprinkle on a bit of extra shredded coconut on top and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord who shares his recipe for some of the best cupcakes we’ve ever had. ~Elise\nMost coconut cupcakes are often a bit too dense and flavorless in my opinion, often presenting bland cake with a avalanche of coconut plopped on top. Tired of coconut cupcake posers, I decided to develop a recipe that would really rally in the flavor of coconut in a cupcake. This one uses coconut milk in place of milk, and butter instead of oil, and has shredded coconut through and through giving it a divine taste that puts other coconut cupcakes to shame.\nIn light of that, the cupcake itself is surprisingly light in texture compared to other coconut cupcakes. The coconut cream cheese frosting enhances the cupcake so each bite is just sweet and exotic, leaving whispers of flavor behind. It is, in my opinion, the ultimate coconut cupcake recipe.\n
861	Turkey Tacos with Cranberry Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare cranberry salsa.  Combine cranberries and apple in a food processor and pulse until coarsely shredded, about 10 short pulses.  Combine shredded cranberries, orange zest, chile, and sugar in a medium bowl.  Let sit 15 minutes for the cranberries to macerate. Add cilantro, lime juice, and salt to taste.    You can also use cranberry relish, just add chopped chiles and cilantro.\n\n2 Heat a large frying pan (preferably cast iron) on medium high heat.  Unless you are using freshly made homemade tortillas, you will need to soften them first.  Working one or two at a time, spread a little butter on one side of the tortilla and fry it in the hot pan for a few seconds on both sides.  Most commercially made tortillas will bubble up a little when cooked like this.  \n\n\n\n3 Sprinkle one side of the tortilla with grated cheese, and cover one half of the tortilla with turkey meat.  Fold over one side of the tortilla onto the other (like an omelette.  Cook until the cheese is melted.  You may need to flip the tacos over to cook the other side, but if the cheese is completely melted this is unnecessary.\n\n4 Serve with cranberry salsa, fresh shredded lettuce (sprinkled first with a little vinegar and salt), and avocados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One of my favorite things to make with leftover turkey is turkey tacos. Usually I have some leftover cranberry relish (I always make too much) to go with the tacos in lieu of salsa, but this time I thought I would make some fresh cranberry salsa from scratch, which turned out surprisingly good. Cranberries just pair so well with turkey, even regular cranberry sauce is going to taste as satisfying with a turkey taco as tomato salsa. Just add a little chopped fresh or pickled jalapenos.\n
862	Turkey Stroganoff	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large sauté pan on medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and dry sauté them (cook them without oil), shaking the pan frequently so they don't stick, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the mushrooms release their water and begin to brown.\n\n2  Add the butter and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 4 minutes, until the onions begin to brown. Sprinkle salt over everything. Add the turkey meat and gravy and stir to combine. Cook for a minute or two, and sprinkle on the thyme, black pepper and nutmeg.\n\n3 Turn off the heat and add the sour cream. You may want to add a few tablespoons of water to thin the sauce. Mix in the sour cream thoroughly. Do not let the sauce come to a simmer or boil or it may curdle. Adjust seasonings to taste. In particular, depending on how salty your gravy was, you may need to add salt.  More than you think.  \n\nServe immediately over egg noodles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What to do with all those turkey leftovers? We decided to make turkey stroganoff with some of ours. Stroganoff is a classic Russian dish, popularized in America after World War II, which typically has beef and mushrooms served in a sour cream sauce. Turkey doesn’t have as strong a flavor as beef, so this stroganoff improves with the addition of some leftover turkey gravy, and extra herbs such as thyme.\n
863	Persimmon Pomegranate Fruit Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGently toss all of the ingredients together.\n\nKeeps for at least a couple of days in the refrigerator, but best eaten same day it is made.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Based on a tip in Alice Waters’ cookbook, The Art of Simple Food, that fuyu persimmons make a good fruit salad, I begged some just picked fuyus from my neighbor and fellow blogger Andrea and set about to make this colorful harvest salad. Persimmons come in two main varieties – fuyu, which are firm and sweet, shaped like a squat pumpkin and can be eaten like an apple, and hachiya, which are acorn shaped and extremely astringent until they are soupy ripe. This persimmon fruit salad is made with the apple-like fuyu variety. To the persimmons I added pomegranate seeds, diced Granny Smith apple, a little lemon juice, mint, and some honey. \nOh, my gosh. This is one of the best fruit salads I’ve ever had, and one of the best things I’ve ever made. So simple too. The mint, lemon, and honey are the only dressing the fruit need. \n
864	Butternut Squash Apple Cranberry Bake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Slice and peel squash and apples. \n\n2 Put squash cubes in ungreased 7x11-inch baking dish. Place apples on top and then cranberries.  Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and nutmeg and sprinkle on top.  Dot with butter.  Bake 50-60 minutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There are two approaches to holiday cooking – fancy and complicated, and simple and easy. (Guess which camp we’re in?) Here is a colorful, simple harvest bake, with chopped butternut squash, tart apples, and cranberries. The hardest part is cutting up the butternut squash (it’s a workout). But then all you have to do is put everything in a casserole and bake it in the oven for an hour. You can make it a day ahead of time and just heat it up in the oven (while the turkey’s resting) before serving. We loved this, next time we may want to add maybe half a cup of toasted walnuts or pecans. Thanks Heidi H of Carlisle, MA for the recipe!\n
880	Pork Roast with Cardamom Mushroom Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the brine.  Dissolve the sugar and salt into the boiling water.  Add it to the cold water.  Add the pepper and stir to combine.  Chill the brine completely in the refrigerator before adding it to the pork.  Submerge pork in the brine solution and chill for 24 hours.  Note that thick, gallon-sized freezer bag is great for brining; if you use one, you probably only need half as much brine solution.  Even if you are using a bag, place in a bowl just in case the bag leaks.  Rinse the roast thoroughly of the brine solution before cooking, pat dry.\n\n2 Preheat oven to 350°F. Purée 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 Tbsp olive oil, 2 teaspoons ground cardamom, and garlic in a food processor or blender. \n\n3 Spread another 1/2 cup chopped onion in center of large roasting pan; top with pork. Sprinkle pork generously with salt and pepper; coat with onion purée. \n\n4 Combine mushrooms, remaining 1/2 cup onion, and 4 Tbsp olive oil in bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper; arrange around pork.\n\n5 Roast pork 1 hour. Remove from oven after one hour and remove the mushrooms, placing them into a large saucepan. Add 1 cup broth and 1/2 cup water to roasting pan. Return roast to oven and roast pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 140°F-145°F, about 15-20 minutes longer. Transfer pork to platter; tent with foil.\n\n\n\n6 Scrape the juices from the roasting pan into the saucepan with the mushrooms. Add the cream, remaining cup of broth, and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom to pan; bring to boil. Blend flour and butter in small cup; mix into mushroom sauce. Cook sauce, stirring often, until reduced enough to coat spoon. Season sauce with salt and pepper; serve with pork.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There are two, no make that three, secrets to making an excellent pork roast. The first is to brine the roast; brining helps the roast retain moisture when it cooks. The second is to not overcook the pork. Take the roast out at 140 to 145°F; the internal temperature will still continue to rise 5 or 10 degrees. Much higher and you have shoe leather. The third tip is to pair the roast with a wonderful sauce, as pork is rather mild and fares well with a good sauce.\nOkay, now that we’ve established the fundamentals, this pork roast with a cardamom onion crust and mushroom sauce is I think, the best pork roast I’ve ever had. Much of this has to do with the fact that the pork was brined overnight and it was cooked to a perfect temperature, the inside still a little pink. But the sauce really takes this roast out of this world. Creamy, mushroom-y, cardamom-y. The recipe is adapted from one in an old Bon Appetit. Normally cardamom is used with Middle Eastern dishes, often with desserts. Who knew that cardamom would work so well in a mushroom cream sauce? This savory sauce is one that I will be making again soon, perhaps next time over chicken breasts.\n
866	Brandied Cranberry, White Chocolate Chip Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put the cranberries in a wide and shallow bowl, pour in a bit of brandy. Enough so they're surrounded by it, but not drowning. Cover and place in the fridge for an hour or more. Afterwards, place a colander over a bowl and pour the cranberries and brandy through, putting the cranberries and the brandy they soaked in aside.\n2 Preheat oven to 375°F. Beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugars and beat again until light, fluffy and well incorporated.\n3 Add the eggs, vanilla extract, and add 1 1/4 teaspoons of the brandy that the cranberries soaked in (as for the rest, I suggest popping it in a glass and topping it off a bit for yourself). Beat well until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl midway through to ensure even mixing.\n4 Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt, then add to the mixture a bit at a time, beating until just mixed. Fold in the brandy soaked cranberries and white chocolate chips. Let chill for 15 minutes in the fridge.\n5 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (a baker's best friend) and place rounded spoonfuls down on the sheet. Bake at 375°F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for a minute, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n*I find that adding the baking soda separately seems to form softer cookies. This is how my mom and grandmother taught me, and if there is actual science behind it, I'm not aware but it seems pretty consistent, and it won't ruin the cookies if you try it this way.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This cookie has become a holiday tradition in my family and always makes an appearance during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Chunks of silky white chocolate help you ease in the holidays while warm and slightly spicy hints of brandy tickle your tongue. Plus with cranberries in full season, taking advantage of these sweet-tart garnet gems just makes sense.\nAny brandy will work great with these; Cognac, Armagnac, and Kirschwasser (a cherry brandy) are particularly fantastic. To give a little extra flavor I add a teaspoon of the brandy that the cranberries soaked in. If you want, you can forego the brandy altogether and just use a teaspoon of vanilla extract (though that does have alcohol) and they’ll still taste great.\n
867	Creamy Sweet Potato Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 5 minutes. Add chopped celery stalks and leek, sauté about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 2 minutes. \n\n2 Add sweet potatoes, chicken stock, cinnamon stick, and nutmeg; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.\n\n3 Remove cinnamon stick and discard. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth. Return to pot. \n\n4 Add half and half and maple syrup and stir over medium-low heat to heat through. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool soup slightly. Cover and refrigerate soup and celery leaves separately. Bring soup to simmer before continuing.) Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with celery leaves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Looking for a special soup to serve over the Thanksgiving holiday? Consider this creamy sweet potato soup seasoned with nutmeg and maple syrup. We found this recipe in an old issue of Bon Appetit and made it this weekend. I kept going back for seconds (thirds, fourths, fifths). The nutmeg and maple syrup give the soup hints of pumpkin pie and glazed yams, as if someone slipped some of each into the blender when the soup was being puréed. The cool and crisp celery tops balance the creamy sweet soup perfectly.\n
868	Kiwi Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlace the kiwifruit, pomegranate seeds, avocado, green onion and olive oil in a medium sized bowl.  Starting with just a teaspoon of chopped jalapeño, gently fold in and add more to your desired level of heat.  Add cilantro.  Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We have a kiwi fruit vine that is rather prolific, to put it mildly. “The untamed beast”, “vine from hell”, or simply “the monster” are a few of the names my father and I have given this plant. Or plants. There may be two of them but I rarely fight my way through the mass of leaves and fruit to see what is really growing there. It’s my mother’s baby, so we are only allowed to cut it back when it threatens to completely overtake the vegetable garden, which it does on a weekly basis all summer long.\nKiwi fruit, also known as Chinese gooseberries, were first marketed to the US by New Zealanders, who call themselves “kiwis” after a native bird of New Zealand. They have a rough brown skin, which once peeled reveals a bright green interior, tart and hard when unripe, soft and sweet when ripe. Although we are used to eating them in the summer, that’s because we’ve been importing them from New Zealand for years. The season for kiwifruit is actually in the fall and winter; we start picking ours in late October.\nWhile in New Zealand last year I consulted with a local chef to see if I find some ideas of things to do with the profusion of kiwi fruit our vines produced. He suggested using them the way one might use a raw tomato, in that they are both acidic and sweet, and recommended making salsa with them. Brilliant! Here is a lovely spicy seasonal salsa that I put together today using a few kiwifruit, with some pomegranate seeds for added color and sweetness, and avocado to balance out the acidity of the kiwifruit. Serve with tacos or steak.\n
869	Salmon Patties	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large bowl, gently mix together the salmon, bread, green onion, garlic, dill, bell pepper, flour, egg, paprika, salt and pepper. Form into 8 patties; each about 1/2 inch thick.\n\n2 Heat oil over medium high heat in a large skillet. Cook the patties until nicely browned on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Raising six kids on a teacher’s salary, my parents were always cooking on a budget. Being Catholic, with the Lenten requirement of meatless Fridays, this meant that we ate a lot of tuna macaroni salad and fried fish. Frequently mom would make tuna patties for us, and less often, because they were more expensive, salmon patties. For the last 3 years my father and I have been trying to talk my mother into making salmon patties for us again. For some unfathomable reason she has refused, even going as far to claim that she never made them in the first place. So dad finally gave up and made these salmon patties himself, with his own spur-of-the-moment recipe. Salmon patties, or salmon cakes, are wonderfully easy to make. The base is just cooked salmon, shredded bread, bread crumbs or even saltines, chopped onion, and egg to bind it all into patties, which are then quickly fried. In this recipe my father dresses up the patties with garlic, dill, bell pepper, and paprika. You could also use parsley, Old Bay seasoning, lemon zest, Worcestershire sauce, or cilantro.\n
870	Pulled Pork Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Purée all of the sauce ingredients (everything except the bay leaf, the pork and the buns) in a blender until smooth. If you have extra time, marinate the pork in the sauce overnight or for several hours before cooking.\n2 Put sauce, bay leaf, and pork into a large pot and add 1 quart of water. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer, covered, turning frequently, for 2 hours or until the meat pulls apart easily with a fork.\n3 Remove from heat and cool pork in the sauce. When cool enough to touch, remove the pork from the sauce and shred into small pieces. Set aside.\n4 Put the sauce back on the stove and bring it to a low boil. Let the sauce boil down until it has been reduced by two thirds. Add the pork back to the sauce. Salt to taste. Remove bay leaf before serving. Serve hot over open-face hamburger buns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Pulled pork sandwiches can hardly be called sandwiches. The sauce soaks into the buns and if you tried to pick one up with your hands it would completely fall apart. Well, perhaps if you used a sturdier bun, and wrapped the sandwich in aluminum foil like a burrito, it could be eaten like a sandwich. We just pile the pulled pork on a hamburger bun and eat it with a fork.\nPulled pork is the perfect slow-cooking winter dish, warm and spicy. This is my father’s pulled pork sandwich recipe, and is, in my humble opinion, the best.\n
871	Lamb Shanks with Butternut Squash	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 4 Tbsp of olive oil in a large cast-iron enameled casserole.  Season the lamb shanks with salt and pepper, add them to the casserole and brown well on all sides, working in batches if necessary, about 8 minutes.  Transfer the shanks to a plate.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat the oven to 350°F and arrange two racks in the oven, one to hold the casserole and one to hold a baking sheet with the squash.  Add the unpeeled garlic cloves, celery, carrots and onion to the casserole.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until glossy, about 2 minutes. Add the wine; boil over high heat until the liquid is very syrupy, about  15 minutes.\n\n3 Return the shanks to the casserole and add the stock and orange zest.  Bring to a simmer.   Cover the casserole and braise the shanks in the oven for about 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender (when we cooked this dish it took 3 hours); turn the shanks from time to time as they cook.\n\n4 Meanwhile, on a large rimmed baking sheet, toss the squash with the remaining 2 Tbsp of olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper and bake in the oven (along with the lamb) for about an hour, or until tender.\n\n5 In a small bowl, mix the minced garlic with the parsley and lemon zest (the "gremolata").  Set aside.\n\n6 Remove the shanks from the oven and transfer to a plate.  Pass the sauce through a coarse strainer, pressing hard on the vegetables.  Discard the vegetable pulp.  Skim the fat from the surface of the sauce.\n\n7 Return the sauce to the casserole, season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil over moderately high heat.  Add the lamb shanks and squash; simmer just until warmed through.  Add the cannellini beans, cover and remove from heat. Let stand for a few minutes to allow for the flavors to blend.\n\n8 Spoon the vegetables and sauce into large shallow bowls and set the lamb shanks on top.  Garnish with the gremolata and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	For those of you snow-bound, this is a rich and hearty dish, perfect for a cold winter day. For me it conjures up images of ski lodges and cabernet, it’s so warm and comforting. Flavorful lamb shanks are first browned and then braised in red wine, stock, and aromatics. Then they are combined with white beans and roasted butternut squash.\n
872	Mushroom Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Preheat oven to 425°F.  Line the inside of a pie shell with heavy aluminum foil, pressing it against the side.  Bake for 8 minutes.  Remove foil, poke the bottom of the pie crust with the tines of a fork to create air vents.  Return crust to oven, bake for an additional 4 minutes, or until the crust just begins to brown.  Remove from oven and let cool.\n\n\n\n2 In a large sauté pan melt butter on medium heat.  Add mushrooms, stir to coat with the butter.  Increase the heat to high, stirring constantly until the moisture the mushrooms has released and evaporated, a few minutes.  Lower heat to medium, add minced garlic, stir with the mushrooms for 30 seconds then remove from heat. \n\n3 Beat together the eggs, sour cream, milk, and cream.  Add freshly ground pepper, a pinch of salt, and cardamom or nutmeg if using. Stir in the grated cheese and chopped parsley.\n\n\n\n4 Spread the sautéed mushrooms along the bottom of the pre-baked pie crust.  Pour the cheese and cream mixture over the top of the mushrooms.  Bake for 30-35 minutes, until nicely browned on top and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Call this mushroom pie a California quiche, with its Monterey Jack cheese, parsley, eggs, sour cream, garlic, and a whole pound of mushrooms. Great for company, and pretty easy to make, especially if you have an extra pie crust all ready to go.\n
873	Champagne Sorbet	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put champagne, sugar, corn syrup, and zest into a saucepan.  Bring to a vigorous boil so that the sugar completely dissolves, remove from heat.\n\n2 Strain into a stainless steel bowl (will help cool down faster), add the grapefruit juice and lemon juice.  Chill completely.  To do this, either place bowl in a larger bowl half-filled with ice water, and stir until champagne solution is completely cold, refreshing the ice in the outer bowl if necessary.  Or you can cover with plastic wrap and chill in your refrigerator over night.  I put the bowl in the ice compartment of our freezer for a couple hours, because it fits, chills quickly, and is far enough away from the other food in the freezer.\n\n3 Process the mixture in your ice cream maker (Amazon sells a good one) according to the ice cream maker directions.  Transfer mixture to a storage container and freezer in your freezer until firm, at least 6 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I love cooking with friends, so when Garrett came over with a bottle of champagne in hand and a suggestion to make champagne sorbet for New Years, I was all over it. Unfortunately, our first two attempts were miserable failures (well, not completely, they made great punch). The problem with trying to freeze champagne, or sparkling wine, is that champagne is 13% alcohol, and alcohol doesn’t freeze, at least not at 32°F. Also, if your sorbet mixture isn’t chilled enough to begin with, it will warm up the freezer bowl of the ice cream maker and the bowl won’t be cold enough to freeze the mixture sufficiently.\nThree more attempts and several days later we now have a lovely champagne sorbet. The trick is to boil the champagne with the sugar when you dissolve the sugar, thus boiling away enough of the alcohol so that the sorbet freezes fine. The grapefruit and lemon juices naturally complement the citrus tones of the champagne. \nHappy New Year!\n
879	Aztec Chocolate Bark	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place the pumpkin seeds in a skillet over medium-low heat. Toast the pumpkin seeds for about 5 minutes, they'll pop and jump a bit as they release their oils and moisture. Allow to cool.\n\n2 Melt the chocolate according to the manufacturer's directions. Once melted add the cinnamon, cayenne pepper, ancho chili powder, and most of the pumpkin seeds saving some to decorate the top with. \n\n3  Spread onto a flat baking pan lined with a silpat or wax paper. Sprinkle over and press into the chocolate the last few pumpkin seeds and sprinkle on a dash more of the spices for color and taste. Place in the freezer for 5 minutes or until hardened. Break into pieces and serve or store in the fridge in an airtight container.  Best consumed in one or two days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord who’s taking a study break to make us spicy chocolate bark. ~Elise\nApparently peppermint bark just isn’t everyone’s favorite winter candy, and admittedly once in a while I get a bit tired of the same ‘ol treats. This however, this is something completely different.\nChocolate was brought to Europe by the conquistadores, who were introduced to it by the Aztecs in what is now modern day Mexico. Prized by the Aztecs, the cacao was ground into a drink and flavored with chili, cinnamon, and honey. “Xocolatl” was often served during important ceremonies and was thought to improve one’s stamina and help fight fatigue.\nWhile not an exact recipe, the flavor echoes from those earlier and exotic times. This chocolate bark is studded with toasted pumpkin seeds, ancho chili, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper creating a nutty, seasonal, and spicy treat. I suggest using some high quality chocolate to ensure superior bark, and you can usually find hulled pumpkin seeds (also called pepitas) at your local natural foods store or Whole Foods. If you are having troubles finding ancho chili powder, chipotle chili powder could be used in a pinch as well while adding a slightly smoky flavor.\n
874	Eggnog Pound Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Soak currants in rum in a small bowl for 15 minutes.\n\n2 Adjust rack to lower third of oven.  Preheat the oven to 325°F (350°F if the pan doesn't have a dark finish).  Butter a 9  to 10 inch bundt pan (original recipe calls for a Festive Cake Pan).\n\n3 Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter until creamy, 30-45 seconds.  Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Scrape bowl with a rubber spatula occasionally as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n\n4 In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg.\n\n5   At very low speed, add dry ingredients in 4 additions, alternating with eggnog (begin and end with dry ingredients).  Scrape bowl occasionally.  Gently fold in orange zest, currants and any remaining rum.\n\n6 Spoon batter into pan; spread evenly. Bake 55-65 minutes, or until cake springs back when touched lightly in the center and pulls away from the sides of the pan.  You can also use a long toothpick or thin bamboo skewer and insert into the thickest part of the cake.  If it comes out clean, it's done.\n\n7 Remove from oven and cool upright in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes.\n\n8 Prepare glaze by blending together sugar, orange juice, and rum.\n\n9 Invert cake onto a rack, over a sheet of waxed paper.  Use a pastry brush to brush the surface of the cake with the glaze.  Cool completely before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here’s a perfect cake for the holidays, an eggnog pound cake. This recipe by Flo Braker is a favorite of my friend Evie, a professional pastry chef, who passed it on to us. If you like eggnog and pound cake, you’ll love this recipe.\n
875	Braised Onions	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Blanch the onions in boiling water for one minute.  Drain and rinse in cold water to stop cooking.  Slice off the ends; slip off the skins.\n\n\n\nIf you are using frozen pearl onions, defrost and drain them before the next step.\n\n2a For "white-braised" onions:\nPut onions in one layer in a saucepan with chicken stock or water coming up halfway.  Add 1 Tbsp butter, season lightly, cover, and simmer slowly 25 minutes, or until tender.  \n\n2b For "brown-braised" onions:\nBefore braising, sauté peeled onions in one layer in butter until lightly browned.  Then add liquid, salt, and 1 teaspoon of sugar; cover and simmer slowly 25 minutes, or until tender.\n\n3 Uncover, boil off excess liquid, and fold in another Tbsp of butter if you wish.  For "creamed" onions add some heavy cream to white-braised onions when they are just tender.  Simmer several minutes until thickened, basting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Braised onions are the side of choice with beef Bourguignon but they are also wonderful with roast beef and other stews. Trader Joe’s sells a pack of multi-colored pearl onions that cook up beautifully as braised onions. The catch? You have to peel them, which requires blanching first, then cutting off the ends so you can slip off the peels. You can of course skip this first step by using pre-peeled frozen pearl onions. I can tell you that if you do choose the blanche and peel approach, it is well worth it. These onions are delicious.\n \nYou can prepare braised pearl onions two ways – “brown braised” in which the onions are first sautéed in butter to brown, or “white braised”, in which the onions are simply braised then cream is often added and reduced.\n
876	Boeuf Bourguignon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Blanch the bacon to remove its smoky taste.  Drop bacon slices into 2 quarts of cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer 6 to 8 minutes.  Drain, rinse in cold water, and dry on paper towels.\n\n2 In a large frying pan, sauté the blanched bacon to brown slightly in a little oil; set them aside and add later to simmer with the beef, using the rendered fat in browning.  Brown the chunks of beef on all sides in the bacon fat and olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and put them into a  heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or covered casserole pan. Cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and add to the pan.\n\n3 Remove all but a little fat from the frying pan, add the sliced vegetables and brown them, and add to the meat.  Deglaze the pan with wine, pouring it into the casserole along with enough stock to almost cover the meat.  Stir in the tomatoes and add the herb bouquet.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer slowly on the lowest heat possible, either on the stove or in a preheated 325°F oven, until the meat is tender, about 1 to 2 hours.\n\n4 While the stew is cooking, prepare the onions.  Blanch the onions in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.  Slice the end tips off of the onions, peel the onions and score the root end with 1/4 inch cuts.  Sauté onions in a single layer in a tablespoon or two of butter until lightly browned.  Add chicken stock or water half way up the sides of the onions.  Add a teaspoon of sugar, and season with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer slowly for 25 minutes or until tender.  The onions should absorb most of the water.  If there is water remaining after cooking, drain the excess.  Set aside.\n\n5 Prepare the mushrooms a few minutes before serving the stew.  Sauté quartered mushrooms in a few tablespoons of butter and olive oil until browned and cooked through.  \n\n6 When the stew meat has cooked sufficiently, remove all solids from the sauce (except the beef) by draining through a colander set over a saucepan. Return the beef to the casserole.  Press juices out of the residue into the cooking liquid, then remove any visible fat and boil down the liquid to 3 cups.   Off heat, whisk in the beurre manié, then simmer for 2 minutes as the sauce thickens lightly.  Correct seasoning and pour over the meat, folding in the onions and mushrooms.  To serve, bring to a simmer, basting meat and vegetables with the sauce for several minutes until hot throughout.\n\nServe with rice, bread, or potatoes (unless you are doing the low-carb version!).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Boeuf Bourguignon is a classic French stew of cubed beef, slow cooked in red wine and broth, and served with sautéed mushrooms and pearl onions. This is a family favorite recipe, from Julia Child’s Boeuf Bourguignon in her book Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom.\n
877	Green Beans with Shallots and Pancetta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Blanch the beans in a large pot of boiling salted water 4 minutes, or until they are crisp tender.  Note:  Test one, if it is "chewy" keep the beans cooking a bit longer.  If you are using French cut beans, or extra thin beans, they may not need to cook as long as 4 minutes; start testing them at 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Drain and place the beans in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.  Drain again and set aside. (At this point you can make the beans a day ahead, store in refrigerator.) \n\n2 Heat a large sauté pan on medium high heat.  Add the diced pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the pancetta from the pan to a plate.\n\n3 Add the shallots to the pan.  Cook, stirring often, on medium high heat, in the fat rendered from the pancetta, until lightly browned. \n\n4 Add butter to the pan; add the drained green beans and pancetta. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Stir constantly until the beans are hot and are well mixed with the shallots and pancetta.  Serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It doesn’t take much to dress up green beans for a holiday meal. In this recipe the beans first blanched and then sautéed with pancetta and shallots, with some salt and freshly ground black pepper for seasoning. You can use thinly sliced onion in place of the shallots or substitute bacon or diced ham for the pancetta if that is what you have on hand.\n \nThe secret to delicious green beans is using beans that are crispy fresh to begin with. Bend one in half; if it breaks easily, it’s fresh, if it just bends, without breaking, then it’s a little passed its prime and you’ll have a tougher time getting the beans to turn out well. The second tip is to not overcook the beans (though if they are older, you might have to cook them longer than usual to get them tender), and to douse them in an ice water bath after boiling to seal in their bright green color and to stop the cooking.\n
878	Stained Glass Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Pre-heat oven to 375°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat.\n\n2 In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream together butter and sugars until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add molasses and vanilla extract, mixing until incorporated. Add egg and mix until light and smooth, about 1 minute on medium speed. \n\n3 Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder.  Fold dry ingredients into wet mixture. Use electric mixer to blend just until flour is incorporated. Divide dough in half and flatten into two disks. Wrap disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour and up to 2 days.\n\n4 Remove any wrappers on candies and separate them by color into plastic bags. Using a mallet to crush candies.\n\n5 Place one disk between two large sheets of waxed paper and roll to 1/4-inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut dough into desired shapes. Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. Using a smaller cookie cutter or a knife, cut shapes into centers of cookies, reserving these center bits to add into extra dough. \n\n\n\n6 Use a spoon to sprinkle the crushed candy into the hollowed-out centers of the cookies, filling to the edges.  Try to keep the candy within the centers.  Any candy specks that fall on the cookie will color the cookie. \n\n7 If cookies will be hung as ornaments or decorations, poke a small hole in the top of each cookie before baking. \n\n8 Bake 9 to 10 minutes. The candy should be melted and bubbling and the cookies just barely beginning to brown. Remove baking sheets from oven and place on wire racks to cool. Allow cookies to cool on pans at least 10 minutes; otherwise, the candy centers may separate from the dough. When cookies are completely cooled, remove and store in an airtight container.  String with ribbon if you want to hang as an ornament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“We can EAT these?” Andrew (age 5) asked incredulously. \n“Yes, you can eat them,” I replied, “they’re cookies. You can also hang them from your tree.”\n“What’s inside?” asked Matthew (7). \n“Lifesavers. And Jolly Ranchers.”\n“LIFESAVERS? AND JOLLY RANCHERS?”\nIt’s as if Santa himself had just poked his head through the fireplace. The boys, my young neighbors, dissected and demolished the ones they had each picked out to eat. It was all I could do to keep their hands off the remaining cookies. Oddly, they went straight for the hard candy center, and only after it was discussed (“What is this, watermelon? Must be a Jolly Rancher”) and devoured, did they move on to the cookie border.\n
881	Liverwurst Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpread bread slice with mayonnaise (and mustard if you prefer), layer on the lettuce and liverwurst slices, top with bread slice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“Eww! Liverwurst!” Thus went a familiar refrain when we were kids and instead of peanut butter and jelly we opened up our lunch box to a liverwurst sandwich. No one, and I mean no one, would trade their sandwich for ours. Even now, just say the word “liverwurst” to an unsuspecting friend and watch their reaction. Sigh. I suspect that if it were called “saucisse de foie de porc” (sausage of pork liver) we wouldn’t have had such a problem with it. But with the combo of “liver” (not every kid’s favorite meal) and “wurst” (sounds a lot like “worst”, as in the worst sandwich ever), we were not predisposed to like it.\nThank goodness we are grown-ups now with more sophisticated palates and an openness to revisit the food prejudices of our youth. (Right? One can only hope.) Seriously, liverwurst tastes a lot like pâté, and is usually made with pork, including up to 20% pork liver. Prepared well, it is absolutely delicious. The question is can you even find it in the stores anymore? We recently found some fantastic liverwurst a local German sausage maker (Morants in Sacramento). Underwood is a brand I remember growing up, though I don’t know how available it is these days. \nLiverwurst sandwiches are typically made with rye or whole grain bread, mustard, and onions. Personally I would skip the onions, unless perhaps they are pickled red onions, as the liverwurst is strong enough in flavor and often has onions ground into it. We always had these sandwiches on white bread growing up, so that’s what I use now, but with Italian or French loaf.\n
882	Peppermint Bark Chocolate Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\n2 Cream the butter and sugars together for about two minutes at medium speed or until well incorporated and light in color.\n\n3 Add the egg and the vanilla extract until well incorporated, about a minute. Be sure to scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl halfway through.\n\n4 Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder. Add to the butter mixture slowly, and beating at medium speed, stopping once all of it is incorporated (do not overmix).\n\n5 Fold in the peppermint bark chips. \n\n6 Take small spoonfuls of the dough and roll into one inch sized balls and place onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for -12 minutes. Let cool on the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Holiday cookie season is in high gear with another one of guest author Garrett McCord‘s delicious cookies. We ate these right after the photo was taken, super chocolate-y! ~Elise\nIf this cookie doesn’t capture the seasonal taste of Christmas, then I don’t know what does. These cookies are chocolatey and oh so fudgy; studded with bright colorful chunks of peppermint bark, they provide a cool cocoa sensation. This cookie matches perfectly with a tall glass of milk next to a well tinseled tree.\nThese peppermint bark chocolate cookies will be the first to be eaten at any cookie swap, and are bound to become a holiday staple after you take your first bite. Perfect for in-laws, holiday parties, or leaving on a plate for Santa, it’s a cookie made to impress. \nYou can buy peppermint bark at any candy store or specialty food store, or you can simply make the peppermint bark yourself. If you want to make life even easier just add some white chocolate chips and crushed peppermint candies in lieu of peppermint bark. \n
883	Peppermint Bark	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Break up peppermint candy into little pieces. Melt the chocolate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once melted, add the peppermint extract and stir.\n2 Pour the melted chocolate out onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and spread out with a spatula or wooden spoon. Sprinkle the peppermint candy chunks on to the chocolate and gently press them in with yours hands.\n3 Place in the freezer for 5 minutes or until hardened. Break into pieces and serve or store in the fridge in an airtight container.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A traditional and quintessential Christmas treat, peppermint bark is ridiculously easy to prepare and can be done in a few minutes. Sweet white or dark chocolate holds in place broken chunks of peppermint candy. Eat it straight, place it in a bag or tin and make it a gift, or break it up into chocolate cupcakes or chocolate cookies.\n
884	Twice Baked Potatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Bake the potatoes.  Preheat the oven to 400°F.  Scrub the potatoes clean under running water.  Poke each potato in several places with the tines of a fork so that when the potatoes are cooking they don't explode.  Rub the potatoes all over with a little olive oil.  Place directly on the middle or top rack of the oven.  Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through.  They should give a little when pressed.\n\nIf short on time you can bake the potatoes in the microwave, 10 minutes on high heat for 2 potatoes, 15 minutes for 4 potatoes.  The skins of microwave baked potatoes aren't nearly as crispy, so you may want to rub a little olive oil on them and  finish them in a conventional oven at 400°F for 10 minutes.\n\n2 If you are including bacon as one of your mix-ins, while the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Let cool.  Crumble.\n\n\n\n3 Allow the potatoes to cool to touch.  Slice the top third lengthwise off the potato.  Use a spoon to scoop out the insides, forming a potato "canoe", leaving about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.\n\nAlternatively you can slice the potatoes in half, lengthwise.  In this case you may want to bake an extra potato so that you will have more potato filling to mound into the potato boats.\n\n4 Place the scooped out potato insides, sour cream, milk, cream, and butter into a large bowl.  Mash with a potato masher.  If you want a creamy texture, beat with an electric beater until desired consistency.  Note, do not over-beat potatoes, they can turn glue-y.\n\n\n\n5 Mix in the extras with the potatoes.  Reserve some of the extras to sprinkle on the tops of the potatoes.  Spoon fillings into the potato shells.  Sprinkle with extra toppings.\n\n6 Heat oven to 350°F.  Place potatoes on a roasting pan and bake 15 to 20 minutes until heated through.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Sometimes deciding what to make for dinner comes starts with the inspiration of just one ingredient. A friend of mine sent us some wonderful blue cheese this week and my father decided that he wanted to make twice baked potatoes with it. Neither one of us has made stuffed potatoes in a while, so we ended up experimenting over several days with various combinations. We settled on two, one a classic twice-baked potato mashed with some combination of sour cream, milk, and butter, and mixed in with crumbled bacon, green onions, and grated cheddar cheese. The other combination uses our blue cheese with some chopped chives. The best thing about this recipe is that it’s wonderfully flexible. The amounts shown are a guideline, but really it’s up to your own imagination and taste. We like a creamy and fluffy potato stuffing, so we add cream and beat the potatoes with a hand mixer. Any combination of topping ingredients will do. \nDo you have a favorite twice-baked potato recipe? If so, please let us know in the comments.\n
885	Borscht	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Bring 4 cups of the beef broth, the beef shank, and onion to boil in large pot. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. \n\n2 Transfer meat to work surface; trim fat, sinew and bone and discard. Chop meat; cover and chill. Cool broth slightly. Chill in pot until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.\n\n3 Spoon fat from top of chilled broth and discard. Add remaining 4 cups broth, beets, carrots, and potato; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. \n\n4 Stir in meat, cabbage and 1/2 cup dill; cook until cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in vinegar. \n\nLadle soup into bowls. Top with sour cream and remaining 1/4 cup dill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My first memorable encounter with borscht was at a pot-luck party I had in San Francisco, in which my friend Elisabeth brought a huge, must have been 12 or 16-quart, pot of drop-dead delicious, deep purply red soup filled with beets. Elisabeth’s grandparents were Ukrainian, and I think borscht was one of her favorite soups to make. Every time I make or eat borscht I think of my friend and the discovery of how good a soup made primarily of beets can be.\nThe wind is howling outside, if any leaves remain on the trees they are sure to come down today. Here is a wonderfully satisfying beet borscht, perfect for a cold weather day.\n
886	Hot Crab Dip	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Beat together the cream cheese, mayonnaise, lemon juice, water, onions, and parsley until smooth. Mix in the Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, and horseradish. Fold in the slivered almonds and lump crab meat. Place in an oven-proof casserole serving dish.\n2 Bake until bubbly and heated through, about 20 minutes. Serve with crackers or thinly sliced baguette.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Winter. Dungeness crab season. Super Bowl.\nNeed I say more?\nIt’s been raining and in the 40s for the last month now (okay, no need to tell me that I’m a California wimp, I know it’s probably worse where you are, heck, dad is from Minnesota, he knows) and any excuse to make something hot and cheerful in the oven is welcome. Here’s a quick, easy, and delicious, piping hot crab dip, perfect for a winter gathering. The base is cream cheese, mayo and crab. We’ve dressed ours up with green onions, parsley, horseradish, slivered almonds and Tabasco. The proportions are guidelines, really this is to taste.\nDo you have a favorite hot crab dip? If so, what’s in it and what do you serve it with?\n
887	Beef Goulash with Dumplings	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large covered sauté pan, heat the olive oil and sauté the onions and sugar until caramelized. Add the garlic and caraway seed. Cook another minute.\n\n2 Add the sweet and spicy paprika, marjoram, thyme and bay leaf. Sauté another minute, until fragrant.\n\n3 Add the tomato paste. Deglaze with the vinegar and the stock and add the pieces of beef, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer.  Cover and cook until very tender, about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.\n\n4 To prepare the dumplings, sift together the cake flour, baking powder and salt.  Combine with the milk and melted butter, mixing lightly.  After the stew has cooked until tender in step 3, drop the dumpling batter by (heaping) teaspoonfuls into  the simmering stew.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes.  Once you have covered the pan, do not uncover while the dumplings are cooking!  In order for them to be light and fluffy, they must steam.  If you uncover the pan, the steam will escape and the dumplings will boil instead.  After 15 minutes, test the dumplings with a toothpick.  If the toothpick comes out clean, the dumplings are done.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What better on a chilly day than a plate of steaming hot beef stew with light, fluffy dumplings? My super-hero father decided to make goulash for us recently and when the first recipe he tried didn’t work out (go figure – it asked for a quarter pound of paprika), down the drain it went (just the base, thank goodness), and back to the drawing board went dad. The recipe we did end up with dad pulled from one of his thick recipe binders, with his own notes from a Wolfgang Puck Food Network show. The dumpling recipe comes from my friend Elizabeth who brought it back with her from a summer in Prague. The combination is a knock-out. Rich, flavorful, spicy beef stew balanced with light dumplings. \n
888	Potato Skins	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Scrub the potatoes clean then bake the potatoes using your favorite method, either oven or microwave.  If using an oven, rub with olive oil and bake in a 400°F oven for about an hour until the potatoes are cooked through and give a little when pressed.  If using a microwave, rub all over with olive oil and cook on the high setting for about 5 minutes per potato.  I have found that baking the potatoes in a conventional oven yields potatoes that are easier to work with (cut and scoop out), the potato seems to adhere to the skins a little better, but there is hardly a discernible difference in the final product. \n\n2 While the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Let cool. Crumble.\n\n\n\n3 Remove the potatoes from the oven and let cool enough to handle.  Cut in half horizontally.  Use a spoon to carefully scoop out the insides, reserving the scooped potatoes for another use, leaving about 1/4 of an inch of potato on the skin.  \n\nIncrease the heat of the oven to 450°F.    Brush or rub grapeseed oil or canola oil (or another high smoke point oil) all over the potato skins, outside and in.  Sprinkle with salt.  Place on a baking rack in a roasting pan (don't use a cookie sheet, it will warp, use a roasting pan or broiler pan that can take the heat).  Cook for 10 minutes on one side, then flip the skins over and cook for another 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool enough to handle.\n\n\n\n4 Arrange the potato skins skin-side down on the roasting pan or rack.  Sprinkle the insides with freshly ground black pepper, cheddar cheese, and crumbled bacon.  Return to the oven.  Broil for an additional 2 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly.  Remove from oven.  Use tongs to place skins on a serving plate.  Add a dollop of sour cream to each skin, sprinkle with green onions.\n\nServe immediately. \n\nNote:  If you have a potato whose skin or flesh has turned green, cut out those parts, do not use them.  The green indicates the presence of a toxin that develops when potatoes are exposed to sunlight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There is nothing like a plate full of crispy potato skins, filled with melty cheddar cheese, and topped with bacon bits, sour cream and green onions. The first time I had these I was 21 years old, at an outdoor cafe on Newbury Street in Boston; I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Oh for the days of youth when one could eat potato skins with wild abandon! I could eat a whole plate back then (and drink a pitcher of beer along with it) and be none the worse. Sigh.\nThese potato skins easy to make. Some approaches call for deep frying, but I don’t think it is really necessary. You just want to bake the skins at a high enough heat so that they get crispy enough to hold the toppings. \n
889	Chicken with Creamy Cassis Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rinse the chicken breasts and pat dry with paper towels.  Dredge them in flour, shake off the excess flour and season with salt and pepper.\n\n2 Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high.  Place the chicken breasts in the skillet and cook, turning once, until both sides are golden brown and the chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a platter, cover with foil to keep warm.\n\n3 Discard excess fat in the skillet.  Add the wine and deglaze, scraping up the browned bits.  Boil the wine down for half a minute, add the crème de cassis and the cream.  Continue to boil down the mixture until it is reduced by a third.  Whisk in the butter.  Add salt and pepper and spoon over chicken breasts to serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s amazing what elegant meals one can serve quickly when one has a well stocked pantry (or liquor cabinet). This is a simple sautéed chicken breast recipe, distinguished by a creamy sauce based on crème de cassis, a lovely sweet dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants. The best quality crème de cassis comes from the Dijon region of France and is used for making the cocktail kir. My father adapted this recipe from one in the reader questions section of a twenty year old Gourmet magazine. It’s based on a recipe for chicken with a Dijon mustard, white wine cream sauce, so if you don’t have access to cassis, you could substitute with a little Dijon mustard. The sauce is delightful; I could see doing something similar with pomegranate molasses or even plum sauce.\n
890	7 Layer Bean Dip	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the refried beans in a medium sauté pan or cast iron skillet. Stir in enough water to get a creamy, easily dip-able consistency, about 1/4 of a cup. The taste of refried beans is greatly enhanced by bacon fat; we'll add a teaspoon to canned beans or a tablespoon or more to taste if we are making the beans from scratch. If you don't have bacon fat, you can cook up a strip of bacon, chop it up fine and add that to the beans. If you are trying to avoid pork, note that most canned refried beans are made with added lard, so check the ingredients. You can use olive oil instead, to help the consistency of the beans.\nMix in the chipotle chili powder (or Tabasco, or adobo, or regular chili powder) and cumin to taste. Note that the avocados and the sour cream will cool down the spiciness of the beans considerably, so you can afford to be a bit more spicy than you might think. Stir in salt to taste, depending on how salted your refried beans are to begin with, and depending on how salty the tortilla chips are that you are serving with the dip.\n2 Once the beans are hot and bubbly, spread them over the bottom of a warmed serving dish. Immediately add the shredded cheese so that the heat from the beans helps melt the cheese. (The cheese doesn't need to be completely melted, but even if it is just a little, it will help the dip stay on the chip.)\n3 Layer on the chopped green chilies, chopped avocado, chopped tomato. Spoon on the sour cream (or crema Mexicana, crema fresca, or even cream fraiche). Top with sliced green onions and olives.\nServe immediately with tortilla chips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Refried beans should not be eaten cold.\nThere, I’ve said it. I don’t usually put my foot down about food preferences, but cold refried beans are about as appealing as a cold hamburger. This is why I make 7-layer dip starting with a layer of hot refried beans. Shredded cheese is added directly to the top of the beans so it melts from the heat of the beans. Then the layers of tomato, avocado, olives, and chilies, onions (mostly room temp) are added. The only cold part of the dip is the topping of sour cream (or crema Mexicana). Served this way and the taste delightfully mimics tostadas or homemade nachos, but in an easy-to-serve dip form.\nBy the way, depending on what you have on hand, your 7-layer dip may have 8 or 9 layers, or 6. The basics are refried beans, grated cheese, avocados (or guacamole), chilies (or salsa), sour cream, and olives. Improvise with more or fewer toppings to your own taste.\n
891	Cheesy Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large bowl, mix together the cheeses and the green onion.   Stir in the mayonnaise and sour cream.  In a separate small bowl blend the butter and garlic until smooth.  Add the butter mixture to the cheese mixture.\n\n2 Preheat broiler.  Slice loaf of bread in half horizontally, lay crust side down.  Spread cheese mixture over the bread.  Place under the broiler until nicely browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\n3 Remove from broiler and let sit for 5 minutes until cool enough to handle.  Slice the bread with a bread knife.  Serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Michelle loves to throw big parties, with plenty of food and plenty of friends. I think it must be the large Italian family thing, one is never at a loss for food or great company at her house. One of my favorite dishes that usually makes an appearance at Michelle’s is this “cheesy bread”, a sort of cross between garlic bread and pizza. It’s a great way to help feed a lot of hungry people, and easy to pull together, even at the last minute. Big thanks to Michelle, who tracked the recipe down from her friend Mark, who is happy to share it with us.\n
892	Classic Baked Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Rinse chicken pieces in water and pat dry with paper towels. Coat the bottom of a roasting pan with olive oil. Rub some olive oil over all of the chicken pieces in the roasting pan. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Arrange the pieces skin-side up in the roasting pan so the largest pieces are in the center (the breasts) and there is a little room between pieces so they aren't crowded in the pan.\n2 Cook for 30 minutes at 400°F. Then lower the heat to 350°F and cook for 10-30 minutes more (approximately 14 to 15 minutes per pound total cooking time) until juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165°F and the thighs 170°. If your chicken pieces aren't browning to your satisfaction, you can put them under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, until browned sufficiently.\n3 Remove roasting pan from oven. Remove chicken from roasting pan to a serving plate. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.\n\n4 To make gravy for the chicken, take the roasting pan with its drippings and place on a medium setting on the stovetop. Use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add a half cup of white wine or chicken stock* to the pan to help deglaze the drippings from the pan.\n\nPour the wine/stock and dripping mixture into a small saucepan and heat on medium high to reduce to desired thickness.\n*While the chicken pieces are baking, if you bought a whole chicken that was then cut into pieces, you may have the back, the neck, and some gizzard pieces to use for making chicken stock. You can chop up the back a little, put it and the neck and gizzards (not the liver) into a small saucepan, barely cover with water, bring to a simmer, cook while the chicken is cooking. When the chicken in the oven is done cooking, use the stock from simmering the extra pieces to make the gravy.\nServe with steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or Spanish rice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This baked chicken recipe is one of those recipes that every home cook should have in their repertoire. It uses a minimal amount of ingredients – chicken, olive oil, salt and pepper (and if you want gravy, chicken stock or white wine) and is especially useful on those busy days when you are just too busy to get creative. My mother makes this chicken about once a month and usually serves it with mango chutney and Spanish rice.\n
893	Roast Wild Duck (Teal)	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 450°F. Inspect duck to see if there are any remaining pin feathers, if so, remove them.  Rinse the duck with water.  Thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly stuff duck with a sprig of rosemary, an apple slice with a few cloves poked in them to hold them in place, and a small wedge of onion.\n\n\n\n2 Slather the duck inside and out with olive oil.  Generously sprinkle all sides of the duck with coarse salt.  Lay, breast up, on a roast rack in a roasting pan.  Place in the middle rack of the oven.  Immediately lower the heat to 425°F.\n\nCooking times depend on the variety of the duck.  Teal ducks typically weigh less than a pound and cook in 10-15 minutes. According to the Joy of Cooking a mallard can take up to 25 minutes. Our duck was perfectly done at 13 minutes.  Another duck we cooked for 17 minutes was slightly overdone.  Meat thermometers are hardly useful with the small fowl because there isn't enough flesh to put the thermometer into.  But if you have an instant read thermometer and can get a good read, my pal Hank suggests cooking until the duck reaches an internal temp of 135°F.  If you error on the rare and underdone side, you can always put the bird back in the oven for a few more minutes if it isn't done enough.\n\nIf you aren't using a meat thermometer, to test for doneness you can take the bird out of the oven and cut a part of it with the tip of a sharp knife.  Note that the juices will run red, and the meat will be quite red.  You want the meat to be rare (wild duck only); it should look like a rare (not raw) steak.  The more the meat is cooked beyond the rare stage, the more "livery" or gamey it will taste.\n\n\n\n3 Remove the duck from the oven and remove to a separate rack or plate to rest, breast side down, for 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the stuffing in the cavity before serving.\n\n4 While the duck is resting, if there are drippings in the roasting pan, pour off the excess fat (save this wonderful fat for another recipe).  Place the roasting pan on the stovetop, heat to medium, and deglaze with a little dry sherry or white wine.  Scrape up the browned bits with a metal spatula.  Use a metal whisk to break up the bits even further into the wine.  Reduce and then add a little cream, (and a few juniper berries if you want an extra touch).  Pour off into a gravy serving dish or little bowl.\n\nServe ducks with wild rice and gravy.  Teal ducks are single serving ducks.\n\nNote that you can get excellent stock from the duck carcass.  Put the duck carcasses in a saucepan, cover with an inch of cold water, bring to a simmer, lower the heat to barely-a-bubble-simmer covered, and cook for 3 hours.  Then strain the stock to a glass jar, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  Use the duck stock in place of chicken stock for recipes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Did you know that the only way you can get a hold of wild duck in this country is by shooting it yourself, or having extraordinarily generous hunter friends who share their bounty? It’s the law. Certain migratory birds can be hunted in season, but not sold. We were the lucky recipients of some teal ducks recently from our hunting friends Hank and Holly. I’ve never eaten, let alone cooked wild duck, and let me tell you, it is an entirely different experience than working with ducks from the grocery store. What follows is a loose recipe and several notes on cooking wild duck, for my own benefit so I remember the next time, as well as for anyone else out there who may have the opportunity to cook wild duck. And for any of you who happened to be seasoned duck hunters, please feel free to offer cooking suggestions in the comments.\n \nThe first thing to note is that wild ducks aren’t like chickens or turkey that you have to cook until 170°F. Wild duck is best eaten rare. The juices run red, not clear, more like a beautiful juicy red steak. The meat itself is a deep garnet red. It is easy to overcook the meat, like overcooking a pork tenderloin. Except when you overcook duck, the meat tastes game-y, like liver. \nThe taste of wild duck is highly dependent on where that duck has been feeding. According to the Joy of Cooking, shallow water ducks feeding on local grains, like mallards, widgeons, and teal, can be very succulent, while diving ducks feed on fish, affecting their flavor. Wild ducks are much more flavorful than domesticated ducks, as their muscles are getting a constant work-out, which is also why their flesh is so red. The taste is closer to steak than to chicken.\nI experimented with two recipes, one with rosemary in the cavity and a sherry cream sauce, and the other with orange rind in the cavity and an orange juice reduction sauce. We all agreed that the rosemary recipe was great and the orange recipe wasn’t worth repeating. So, here is the recipe we liked, note that there are no set amounts, this recipe is more of a loose guideline than anything else.\n
894	Pickled Red Onions	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Blanch red onions in a saucepan of boiling water for 2 minutes.  Drain in colander.\n\n2 While the water is heating in step 1, in a separate saucepan combine the vinegar, sugar and spices.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n3 Add blanched, drained onions to the vinegar mixture.  Simmer for 1 minute.\n\n4 Transfer to a glass jar.  Allow to stand until cooled.  Will keep several weeks refrigerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I keep on making things that when I think about it, would be enhanced with some pickled red onions. Bean soup, liverwurst, salmon, and especially hot dogs and hamburgers would all be terrific with some pickled onions on the side. All you really need to make pickled red onions is some sliced red onion, vinegar and sugar. There’s lots of leeway with the spices and herbs used. For this batch I used cinnamon, cloves, star anise, bay leaf and red pepper flakes. You could easily thrown in some ginger, swap out the chile flakes for some cumin, or allspice for the cloves.\n
895	Black Bean Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place beans and ham hock in a 4-quart, thick-bottomed pot. Add 5 cups water, bay leaves, salt and baking soda. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a low simmer. Cover and let cook 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, until beans are tender. Remove bay leaves. Remove ham hock from the pot. Cut ham meat away from the bone and cut into small, bite-sized pieces, set aside.\n2 Heat olive oil in a large 8-quart thick-bottomed pot on medium high until the oil is hot, but not smoking. Add the onions, celery, sweet potato and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and softened, about 10-15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add the cumin, chili powder, and garlic, cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\n3 Add the beans, their cooking liquid, chicken stock, molasses, and bell pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes.\n4 Remove 4 cups of the soup (about half of it) to a blender. Purée until smooth and return to the pot of soup. (You may need to purée the soup in smaller portions, depending on the size of your blender. Don't fill the blender more than half way at a time and hold the lid while blending.) Add back the ham pieces to the soup. Add 3 Tbsp of lime juice. Adjust seasonings. If on the sweet side, add a bit more lime juice. Salt to taste.\nServe with garnishes.\nNote that the soup may continue to thicken. If you would like it thinner, just add some water to desired consistency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	As some of you may be aware, California has been hit with some stormy weather recently. We warm-weather low-landers don’t do cold and wet too well and for the last several days of rainy and cold I’ve been craving some hot, hearty, black bean soup. I love black bean soup thick, almost stew-like; if you like yours thinner, feel free to add water or more chicken stock to this recipe. Soup like this is mostly an improvisation. The foundation ingredients are the black beans, the smoked ham hock, the onions, and the spices. But even the ham hock you could substitute with some good bacon. Starting out with dry beans means that you can cook them (after a good soaking) for a long time with the smokey ham, allowing the flavor to really infuse the beans. Do you have a favorite way of preparing black bean soup? If so, please let us know in the comments.\n
896	Apple Carrot Cupcake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350° and place rack in the center of the oven. \n\n2 In a large bowl, combine flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, baking powder, spices, cocoa, pepper, and salt. Whisk to combine, then stir in oil and eggs. Stir in carrots, apples, and pecans.\n\n3 Set aluminum or paper cupcake holders in muffin tins. Spoon the batter into the cupcake paper cups, three-quarters of the way to the top. Bake approximately 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cool completely before frosting.\n\n4  Beat goat cheese, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Gradually add powdered sugar and mix until combined.\nOnce cupcakes are cool, apply frosting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s as if our carrot cake and our apple cake decided to get together and have babies. (What really happened is that my father wanted to make a great 3-layer spice cake from Sunset magazine for the 3rd time in a month and I convinced him that cupcakes would be a better way to go.) \n
897	Shrimp Quesadilla	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If you are starting with frozen raw shrimp, defrost them by placing them in a bowl of ice water until defrosted.  Then poach the raw shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes in boiling water, remove from pan with a slotted spoon, and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.  If you are starting with frozen cooked shrimp, you can defrost them in a bowl of ice water or lemon juice with ice.\n\n2 Place strained cooked shrimp in a bowl.  Add lime or lemon juice, some chopped fresh jalapeno or serrano chile and/or a dash of chile powder (can also use chipotle chiles or chipotle chili powder) to desired level of heat, green onion, and cilantro.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Let marinate for 10 to 30 minutes.  Strain out the juice.\n\n3 Heat a cast iron or stick-free skillet on medium high. Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2 teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you could use butter as well).  Place one flour tortilla on the skillet.  Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla. Remove the tortilla and repeat with the second tortilla.  Leave the second tortilla in the pan and reduce the heat to medium.\n\n\n\n4 Sprinkle the tortilla with the grated cheese.  Distribute the shrimp mixture on top of the cheese.  Place the other tortilla on top. Using two spatulas (one to hold the top in place) flip the quesadilla over when the bottom tortilla is nicely toasted and the cheese has begun to melt.  Remove the quesadilla from the pan when the now bottom tortilla has toasted sufficiently.\n\nYou can also use just one tortilla instead of two, and fold the tortilla over itself like an omelette.\n\n5 Cut like a pie into six pieces.  A pizza wheel works well for this.  Place on a serving plate.  Serve with avocado slices and sour cream.  Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Quesadillas have to be my favorite go-to food for lunch. They’re just so easy to make! Especially when you have tortillas and cheese in the fridge, which we almost always do. Recently I had lunch with an old friend at Buck’s of Woodside, a rather famous hang-out for Silicon Valley venture capitalists, and had a spectacular marinated shrimp and Jack cheese quesadilla, smothered in avocado and creme fresca, served on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce. I’ve created my own version here, inspired by that wonderful lunch at Buck’s. I could eat these all day.\n
898	Baked Scallops	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Place scallops in a medium sauté pan.  Add the wine and a pinch of salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, cover and simmer for 4 minutes.  No longer.  Remove the scallops to a 1.5 quart casserole baking dish.  Pour off the cooking liquid to a separate container and reserve.\n\n2 Heat 3 Tbsp butter in the sauté pan on medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until wilted, a couple minutes.  \n\n3 Slowly sprinkle the flour and add the cooking liquid over the butter onion mixture, whisking vigorously while you do so.  As soon as the sauce is thickened, add it to the scallops in the casserole baking dish. Stir to fully incorporate the scallops into the sauce.  \n\n4 Sprinkle bread crumbs over the scallops and dot with the remaining 3 Tbsp butter.  Bake in the oven at 400°F until bubbly and brown, approximately 15 minutes.\n\nServe with lemon slices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father had never eaten scallops before this year, but he was so inspired by this scallop dish prepared by his friends Fred and Patricia, he has spent much of the last month experimenting with them. What I love about this recipe is it’s so easy to make and it cooks up so quickly. We used the larger sea scallops for this version, but dad remembers Patricia using bay scallops when she made them for him. The scallops are essentially baked in a white sauce of butter, white wine, and flour, with a bread crumb topping.\n
899	Kumquat Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombine all ingredients. Add more or less red pepper and cayenne to desired heat. Let sit for 1 hour for the flavors to more fully blend.\nGreat served with steak or seafood such as halibut, black sea bass, or salmon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever tried a kumquat? They’re these little citrus fruits, like miniature oranges, not much bigger than a grape, that you can eat whole, even the seeds. You can slice them and add them to salads, or just pop them into your mouth for a quick snack. Garrett stopped by the other day with a container filled with kumquats (don’t you love friends who bring you food?) and a mission to make salsa and to photograph some cheese. What follows is the citrus-y salsa we made with the kumquats, which I’ve been eating up with fish and in steak tacos. You could easily add some chopped mango or avocado to the salsa, and chop it up more finely if you wanted to use it as a dip for tortilla chips. Looking for other things to make with kumquats? Check out the list at the end of the recipe with ideas from other food bloggers.\n
900	Chicken Piccata	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Cut the chicken breast halves horizontally, butterflying them open. If the breast pieces you are working with are large, you may want to cut them each into two pieces. If the pieces are still thick after butterflying, put them between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound them with a meat hammer to 1/4-inch thickness.\n2 Mix together the flour, salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan. Rinse the chicken pieces in water. Dredge them thoroughly in the flour mixture, until well coated.\n\n3 Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add half of the chicken pieces, do not crowd the pan. Brown well on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve to a plate. Cook the other breasts in the same manner, remove from pan. Cover with aluminum foil and keep warm in the oven while you prepare the sauce.\n4 Add the chicken stock (or white wine), lemon juice, and capers to the pan. Use a spatula to scrape up the browned bits. Reduce the sauce by half. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Plate the chicken and serve with the sauce poured over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Sometimes it amazes me how a simple combination of basic, on-hand ingredients can yield such delightful results. Chicken piccata is nothing more than chicken breast cutlets, dredged in flour, browned, and served with a sauce of butter, lemon juice, capers, and either stock or white wine. It can be prepared in 20 minutes or less and is so easy and delicious it should be part of every home cook’s repertoire. I confess I never even heard of this dish until several of you requested a recipe for it over the course of the last couple months. So, thank you for your suggestions, this is a good one!\n
941	Spinach and Orzo Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cook the orzo pasta.  Bring to a boil a pot with 2 quarts of water in it. Once the water is boiling, salt it with a couple teaspoons of salt. Once the water returns to a boil add the orzo to the pot. Leave uncovered, cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm). Drain.  Rinse with cold water to cool quickly.\n\n2 Toast the pine nuts by heating a small skillet on medium heat.  Add the pine nuts and stir occasionally until the pine nuts are lightly browned.  Pay attention or you'll burn the pine nuts.\n\n3 Take half of the spinach and purée it in a food processor or blender, adding one tablespoon of the olive oil.  Roughly chop the other half of the spinach.  In a large serving bowl mix the spinach purée olive oil mixture in with cooked orzo until the pasta is well coated with the purée.  Then gently mix in the remaining spinach, the red onion, feta cheese, pine nuts, and the Kalamata olives.\n\n3 In a small jar, combine the remaining olive oil (2 Tbsp), balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar,  mustard, dried basil, and dried tarragon.  Put a lid on the jar and shake to combine.  (You can also just whisk together these ingredients in a small bowl, but the jar method works great to get a good emulsion.)  Pour over orzo spinach mixture and gently mix in until well incorporated.\n\n4 Chill for at least an hour before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“Needs more cheese.” “Needs more vinegar.” “Needs fewer olives.” “You could add more spinach.”\nMy parents love it when I cook for them, especially when it’s a new recipe and they get to be the taste testers. They happily put up with the delays to the meal due to my tweaking the dish as they “dish out” their suggestions. And with the delays that come from my attempts to take the perfect photo (“Don’t touch that, I still haven’t shot it!”). I love their input, as they know much more about food than I do, and their suggestions almost always result in something better. \nThis spinach, orzo, and feta salad recipe comes from our happy family collaboration. Feel free to experiment with the proportions. Many recipes I’ve found online call for twice as much orzo to the other ingredients than I’ve listed here. I think there is a lot of room for maneuvering when you are working with great ingredients like these.\n
901	Kale and Roasted Vegetable Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F (reduce heat by 25°F if using convection oven). Brush rimmed baking sheet with a thin coat of olive oil. Arrange carrots, squash, tomatoes, onion, and garlic on sheet. Drizzle with more olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast vegetables until they are brown and tender, stirring occassionally, about 45 minutes.\n2 Cut squash and carrots into 1/2 inch pieces; set aside. Peel garlic cloves; place in food processor. Add tomatoes and onion; puree until almost smooth. Pour 1/2 cup broth onto the baking sheet; scrape up any browned bits. Transfer broth and vegetable puree to large pot. Add 5 1/2 cups broth, kale, thyme and bay leaf to pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer uncovered until kale is tender, about 30 minutes.\n3 Add carrots, beans, and squash to soup. Simmer 8 minutes to blend flavors, adding more broth to thin soup if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.\nCan be made a day ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We first posted this kale soup recipe four years ago and it has since become a regular winter staple in our home. Roasted vegetables, puréed and then cooked with broth, kale, and white beans make up this hearty soup. Of all the leafy green vegetables, kale is my least favorite; I usually find it too bitter. But in this soup, matched with the savory roasted vegetables and buttery beans, it’s fabulous.\n
902	Meyer Lemon Marmalade	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreparing the fruit\n1 Scrub the lemons clean. Discard any that are moldy or damaged.\n\n2 Prepare the lemons. Cut 1/4 inch off from the ends of the lemons. Working one at a time, stand a lemon on end. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise. Cut each lemon half into several segments, lengthwise.\n\nAs you cut the lemons into segments, if you can, pull off any exposed membranes. Just get the ones that are easy to get to, ignore the rest. When you've cut down to the final segment, cut away the pithy core. Remove all seeds from the segments. Reserve the seeds and any removed membrane or pith. You will need them to make pectin.\n\nCut each lemon segment crosswise into even pieces to make little triangles of lemon peel and pulp.\n\n3 Put all of the seeds, membranes and pith you removed from the lemons into a bag fashioned out of two layers of cheesecloth or a muslin jelly bag.\n \nFirst stage of cooking\n\n4 Place the lemon segments and water into a large, wide pot.\n5 Place the pectin bag in the pot with the fruit pulp and secure to the pot handle.\n6 Bring mixture to a strong boil on high heat. Let boil, uncovered, for about 25-35 minutes, until the peels are soft and cooked through. (If too much of the water evaporates from the boil and the peels start sticking to the bottom of the pan, add a little more water back in.) Test one of the lemon peel pieces by eating it. It should be soft. If it is still chewy, keep cooking until soft.\nRemove from heat.\n7 Remove the pectin bag, place the pectin bag in a bowl and let cool until it is comfortable to touch.\nAdd the pectin and sugar\n\n8 Once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, if you want, squeeze it like play-doh to extract any extra pectin. This is not necessary but will help ensure a good set. (I like to wear latex-type gloves for this part.) You should be able to get a tablespoon or two more from the bag. It has the consistency of sour cream. Return this pectin to the pan with the lemon mixture.\n9 Measure out your sugar and add it to the pan with the lemon mixture.\n \nSecond stage of cooking\n\n10 Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. The marmalade may take anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes or so to be ready to pour out. After about 15 minutes, start checking it frequently.\n\n\nToo runny to be ready\nIt's wrinkly, so it's ready\n11 There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars - the mixture reaching a temperature of 119-220°F (7-8°F above the boiling point at your altitude) and a bit of it put on a chilled plate "wrinkling up" when you push it with your finger tip. I do both.\nFor the wrinkle test, put several small plates into the freezer. As the jelly temperature reaches 217°F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn't ready. If it holds its shape a bit, like an egg yolk, that's a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.\nWhen you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure that the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. This may mean that you have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.\n \nCanning\n\n12 While the marmalade is in its second cooking stage, rinse out your canning jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven. They should be in the oven at least 10 minutes before using them.\n13 As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.\n14 Once the jelly has reached 220°F or its "wrinkly" stage, remove the jelly pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the jelly into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal. Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.\n15 Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.\nEven if the jelly is not firm as it goes into the jar (it shouldn't be), it should firm up as it cools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This marmalade is delicious, everyone here loves it, and the recipe is pretty straightforward. I’ve detailed as much of the method as I could, to make it easier for any of you who might try the recipe to be successful with it. Jam making is tricky; it really helps to do it a bunch of times; the more experience you have with it, the better jams you’ll make. If you are just starting out with jam making, use a candy thermometer! Once you have enough jam making experience, you can more easily judge when the jam is ready without one, but until then, use one.\n
903	Sesame Fish Sticks	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Rinse the fish fillets in cold water.  Cut them into approximate 1 inch by 5 inch pieces, following the lines of the fillets.  Remove any bones that may remain in the fillets.  Lay out 3 separate dishes for dredging, one with flour that has salt and pepper sprinkled and mixed in, one with beaten egg, and the last with sesame seeds. Dredge the fish sticks first in flour, then in beaten egg, then in sesame seeds.  Reserve to a plate.\n\n\n\n2 Put enough vegetable oil in a large skillet to generously coat the bottom of the pan (about 1/4 cup).  Heat the skillet on medium high until the oil is shimmering.  Test the oil by dropping a bit of flour into the pan, if it sizzles the pan is ready.  Working in batches, add the fish sticks to the pan, leaving enough room around them so that they aren't crowded.  Cook for a few minutes on each side, until they are well browned on all sides.  Remove the fish sticks to a plate lined with a paper towel.  Keep warmed in the oven at 160°F while you finish frying the other batches of fish sticks.  Add more oil as necessary to the pan to keep the bottom of the pan coated as you fry subsequent batches.\n\n3  To make either of the dipping sauces, put the sauce ingredients into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, let cook for 4 minutes, uncovered.  Remove from heat and let cool a little before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Fish sticks don’t have to come from a box; they’re easy enough to make. A friend recently gave me a great cookbook for kids (thanks, Nicky!) that had this fun-sounding recipe for sesame fish sticks, just the thing you might be able to convince a kid to try cooking. I didn’t have any kids close by to corral into cooking today, but made some for my folks (do they count as kids?) who loved them. The original recipe calls for serving them with tartar sauce or ketchup, but I think the sesame coating goes well with an orange or Asian dipping sauce; I’ve included recipes for both.\n
904	Baklava	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Lightly grease a 9x13 pan and set the oven to 350°F. \n\n2 Thaw the phyllo dough according to manufacturer's directions (this may take overnight). When thawed, roll out the dough and cut the dough in half so the sheets will fit in the pan. Cover with a damp towel to keep it from drying out. \n\n3 Process the nuts until in small, even sized pieces. Combine with sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. In a separate bowl, melt the butter in the microwave.\n\n4 Place a sheet of phyllo dough into the pan. Using a pastry brush, brush the phyllo sheet with melted butter. Repeat 7 more times until it is 8 sheets thick, each sheet being "painted" with the butter.\n\n5 Spoon on a thin layer of the nut mixture. Cover with two more sheets of phyllo, brushing each one with butter. Continue to repeat the nut mixture and two buttered sheets of phyllo until the nut mixture is all used up. The top layer should be 8 phyllo sheets thick, each sheet being individually buttered. Do not worry if the sheets crinkle up a bit, it will just add more texture. \n\n6 Cut into 24 equal sized squares using a sharp knife. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes or until lightly golden brown, and edges appear slightly crisp.\n\n7 While baking, make the syrup. Combine the cinnamon stick, sugar, lemon juice, honey, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium low heat and let simmer for 7 minutes and slightly thickened. Remove the cinnamon stick and allow to cool.\n\n8 Spoon the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let cool for at least 4 hours. Garnish with some finely crushed pistachios of desired. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Simply Recipes guest author Garrett McCord who brought us some of the best baklava we’ve ever tasted. ~Elise\nHave I ever mentioned that I’m a baklava addict? It’s true, I have a problem and should be taken to the Betty Crocker Clinic so I can get help. Last year I bought a 30 serving pan of the stuff, intent on bringing it to work to share. Four hours later the entire pan was gone and I was a sticky mess. As such, it was only a matter of time before I learned to make my own. \n \nBaklava is a delicious phyllo pastry popular in Middle Eastern countries. Its supposed origins are Turkish, dating to the Byzantine Empire (or even further), though many cultures claim it for their own. Many Greek and Lebanese restaurants serve it, and it is now a featured dessert of several former Ottoman countries. In baklava, layers of crisp phyllo dough alternate with a sugary spiced nut mixture, and the whole thing is then soaked in fragrant sweet syrup made with honey, lemon and cinnamon. It’s an exotic and decadent treat to be sure.\nThe recipe can be a bit time consuming, and isn’t really a first-time baker’s recipe, but if you can put together a cake well enough on your own then this is a good next step in your baking education. The tissue paper-thin phyllo dough is fragile and breaks easily if not handled properly, but the end product is forgiving so don’t fret if it all falls apart. My first time I just made a mess of dried out phyllo and butter and the baklava tasted wonderful regardless. \n
905	Spare Ribs, Cabbage, and Sauerkraut	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Rub the ribs with garlic, caraway seeds, and cracked black pepper.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours (if you have time, otherwise skip).\n\n2 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Unwrap ribs from plastic wrap.  Season the ribs with salt and pepper.  Wrap the ribs with aluminum foil and place them on a roasting pan.  Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until tender.  Remove from oven and set aside.\n\n3 Place sauerkraut, onion, caraway seed, brown sugar, and cabbage in a Dutch oven.  Stir in beer, water, and chicken stock.  Add pepper to taste.  Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F.  Bake the sauerkraut cabbage mixture, covered, for 3 hours. \n\n4 Lower the oven temperature to 325°F.  Place ribs over sauerkraut, cover, and cook for an additional hour.  Add more liquid if needed.\n\nServe the ribs with the sauerkraut.  Good with boiled potatoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Leave it to my Germanic father to find yet another twist on pork and sauerkraut. Yes, we already have a perfectly good recipe for spare ribs and sauerkraut which we’ve been making for years. No, that’s not enough to deter the siren call of something potentially even better. Dad found a recipe for spare ribs in The Niman Ranch Cookbook to which he incorporated a completely different way of cooking the sauerkraut, one that includes slow cooking cabbage and sauerkraut together with beer.\nOkay, spare ribs, cabbage, sauerkraut, and now beer? No wonder he loves this recipe. It does take twice as long to make as our other recipe. But it really is amazingly good, and so worth it if you can make the time.\n
906	Dad’s Fish Stew	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat olive oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and garlic and sauté 4 minutes. Add parsley and stir 2 minutes. Add tomato and tomato paste, and gently cook for 10 minutes or so.\n2 Add clam juice, dry white wine, and fish and simmer until fish is cooked through, less than 10 minutes. Add seasoning. Salt to taste. Ladle into bowls and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father has been making this soup for several years now. It is incredibly easy to make, given how tasty the results. The key ingredient is the clam juice, though I have prepared it for people with shellfish allergies substituting the clam juice with white wine, fish stock, or water. It works, just not quite as tasty. Works well with white fish, though firmer is better. My favorites are cod or halibut for this stew. You can also use tilapia or sole.\n
907	Mom’s Perfect Pork Chops	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large cast iron frying pan to medium high or high heat (hot enough to sear the meat). While the pan is heating, sprinkle a pinch of dry rub spices (about 1/8 teaspoon or a little more) on each of the pork chops. Using your fingers, rub the spices into the meat. Turn the chops over and repeat on the other side.\n2 Once the pan is hot, add a teaspoon of oil or fat to the pan and coat the bottom of the pan. Right before you put the chops into the pan sprinkle each side with a little salt, or you can salt the chops in the pan. Put the chops in the pan. Make sure they are not crowding each other too much. There should be space between the chops in the pan or the meat will steam and not sear properly.\nTip: Arrange the chops in the pan with the thickest, boniest parts towards the center of the pan where they get the most heat.\n3 Sear the chops, about 2 minutes on each side. Watch carefully, as soon as the chops are browned, flip them. As soon as you flip the chops, if you are using a cast iron pan, you can turn off the heat. Cast iron holds heat very well and there will be enough heat in the pan to finish cooking the meat.\nIf you have chops that are a lot thicker than 3/4" (many are sold that are 1 1/2"-thick), you can put a cover on the pan and let the chops finish cook for 5 minutes or so (if you are using a cast iron pan and have turned off the heat, there should be enough heat if you cover the pan to finish the cooking of a thicker chop, if not, lower the heat to low and cover.\nHow do you know when the chops are done? Mom uses a touch test which with practice I've learned as well. If you wait until you see juice oozing out of the top of the chop, it is definitely done. Mom typically just keeps the chops in the pan, the heat is turned off, so the pan is losing heat. The pan initially provides enough heat to sear the second side. As it initially cools it is still cooking, though not searing the meat. After a couple of minutes, it's just keeping the chops warm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Sometimes the best food is really the simplest. We experiment frequently with different ways of preparing pork chops, but the way we have pork chops most regularly is with a simple dry rub and pan frying. My mother’s been making chops this way for years. We use a dry rub of my father’s, which requires some advance preparation (when you make some, you make more than you need than for just a few pork chops). If we are out of the dry rub, mom typically uses a bit of paprika, salt and pepper to season the chops.\n
908	Creamed Spinach with Bacon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cut off the thick stems of the spinach and discard. Clean the spinach by filling up your sink with water and soaking the spinach to loosen any sand or dirt. Drain the spinach and then repeat soaking and draining. \n\n2 Blanch the spinach in a pot of boiling water until the spinach is wilted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the spinach from cooking further.  Squeeze the spinach to remove all the moisture possible.  Chop the spinach and set aside.\n\n3 Heat a large skillet on medium high.  Add the chopped bacon and sauté until the bacon begins to render some of its fat.  Add the chopped onion and garlic.  Sauté until onions are translucent.\n\n4 Make the béchamel sauce. Melt butter in a small saucepan on medium/low heat until it just starts to bubble. Add the flour and cook, stirring until smooth, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk, whisking continuously, cooking until thick. \n\n5 Combine spinach, bacon and onion mixture, and béchamel sauce into one pan.  Add nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, remove from heat and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If you’ve been reading this site for a while you’ll know that we are big spinach fans here. We get spinach fresh from the farmers market every Saturday morning, and it disappears quickly. Here is a creamed spinach dish that my father made for dinner the other night inspired from a recipe he found in the Sacramento Bee. The spinach gets its creaminess from a bechamél sauce based on a flour and butter roux. There’s actually no cream in the spinach, it uses milk instead. The bacon adds wonderful flavor, but you can easily skip it if you are so inclined.\n
909	Huevos Rancheros	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Make the sauce first by softening the onions in a little olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat.  Once translucent, add the tomatoes and the juice the tomatoes are packed in.  Break up the tomatoes with your fingers as you put them in the pan.  If you are using fresh tomatoes, chop them first, then add.  Note that fresh tomatoes will take longer to cook as canned tomatoes are already cooked to begin with.  Add chopped green chilies.   Add additional chili to taste, either chipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, regular chili powder, or even ground cumin.  Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and let simmer while you do the rest of the cooking, stirring occasionally. Reduce to warm after it has been simmering for 10 minutes.  Add salt to taste if needed.\n\n\n\n2 Prepare the tortillas.  Heat the oven to a warm 150°F, place serving plates in the oven to keep warm.  Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet on medium high, coating the pan with the oil.  One by one (or more if your pan is big enough) heat the tortillas in the pan, a minute or two on each side, until they are heated through, softened, and pockets of air bubble up inside of them.  Then remove them and stack them on one of the warming plates in the oven to keep warm while you continue cooking the rest of the tortillas and the eggs.\n\n\n\n3 Fry the eggs.  Using the same skillet as was used for the tortillas, add a little butter to the pan, about two teaspoons for 4 eggs.  Heat the pan on medium high heat.  Crack 4 eggs into the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes for runny yolks, more for firmer eggs.  \n\nTo serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto a warmed plate.  Top with a tortilla, then a fried egg.  Top with more sauce, sprinkle with cilantro if desired.  \nServe either one or two eggs/tortillas per plate, depending on how much you want to eat.  I'm a 2-egg 2 tortilla person myself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	One great benefit of growing up in California (LA actually) and having a Hispanic mother is being exposed at an early age to Mexican food. From the time I was 5 it was my job to prepare the salsa for the family. We have always had tortillas in the house like most people have bread in theirs. Consequently dishes that call for salsa and tortillas are likely to be prepared often, as we cook with what is on hand. Huevos rancheros is one of those dishes. A classic Mexican breakfast, huevos rancheros are fried eggs served on hot corn tortillas and smothered in cooked salsa. (Made them for lunch today and I’m getting hungry all over again just thinking about them.) In our home “huevos” can mean eggs either scrambled or fried. When they’re fried the runny yolk mixes in with everything, the salsa, the tortillas. I love to take a piece of tortilla and dip it in the yolk and then the salsa. Aye aye aye, this is good.\n
910	Chocolate Dipped Strawberries	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Wash and dry the strawberries, making sure the berries are fully dry as water will cause chocolate to seize up.\n\n2 Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Follow the melting directions on the package. \n\n\n\n3 Dip the strawberry in the white chocolate, holding onto the stem or the "shoulders" of the strawberry. Give it a quick little twist and shake with your fingers to shake off the excess and then point it at the ceiling for a second or two to ensure that the chocolate adheres. Place on a piece of wax paper to let dry.\n\n\n\n4 Melt the dark chocolate according to the instructions on the package. Dip the strawberry in at a 45 degree angle from both sides to make the "jacket". Let the excess drip off. Place on wax paper to dry.\n\n\n\n5 Place some melted dark chocolate into a piping bag with a very small tip, or in a ziplock bag with the little corner snipped off and pipe on buttons and bow tie.\n\n6 Allow to dry and cool. (If drying seems to go too slowly, place them in the freezer for about 3-5 minutes.)\n\nBest eaten the day they are made.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Another Valentine’s treat from Garrett McCord. Enjoy! ~Elise\nA classic little treat perfect for a date or as a gift, chocolate covered strawberries are a defined part of romance in America. Dressed up to the nines in white and dark chocolate tuxedos, they have some cuteness added to them here. It’s a treat that’s perfect for that special someone. \n
911	Chocolate Fondue	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Warm the cream over moderate heat until tiny bubbles show and begins to lightly and slowly boil. Add the chocolate and whisk until smooth and full incorporated.\n2 Immediately transfer to a fondue pot heated at low or with a low flame, or serve straight from the pot.\n3 Arrange the dippables on a platter or plates around the chocolate pot. Use a fondue fork, bamboo skewer, seafood fork, or salad fork to dip the fruit pieces and other dippables into the hot melted cream chocolate mixture. Eat immediately.\nIf the fondue begins to feel a little stiff, add a tablespoon of heavy cream and stir. It will help it go a little longer. Eventually, it will cook down though and you may need to start a new pot.\nVariations\nAdd a tablespoon or two of Bailey's Irish Cream to the chocolate. Other liquors such as Grand Marnier, Amaretto, or Kirsch are equally yummy.\nAdd a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and ancho chili pepper for a nice Mexican Chocolate.\nThe contents of a vanilla pod or some vanilla extract are always a decadent touch to chocolate.\nA good pinch of espresso powder can do wonders!\nOrange zest or grapefruit zest is nice way to create a slightly fruity chocolate.\nA few tablespoons of Torani flavoring syrups (the kind used for coffee or Italian sodas) can add a nice dimension of flavor as well.\nWhite chocolate is always a nice change, and spiked with a little liquor or citrus zest becomes heavenly.\nSteeping the cream for an hour beforehand and while heating it can add a nice subtle flavor, lemongrass for white chocolate or a bag of Earl Grey tea for dark chocolate are particularly stylish and contemporary.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord. ~Elise\nFondue has finally made a comeback, as most culinary fads eventually do, but this time with a bit of spark. Back in the seventies a party wasn’t groovy unless a fondue pot was rolling. Nowadays, fondue fountains and fondue restaurants are all the rage but few people seem to be doing them at home, which is a shame considering how easy (and cheap) it is. Fondue gatherings are also a great chance to be interactive at the table and even those who don’t cook can enjoy the simple play of dipping and eating.\nChocolate fondue in particular is laughably simple. Melted chocolate becomes the base for infinite varieties of dippables. Plus the chocolate can easily be flavored to perk the senses and create astounding flavors and variety. While great for a party, chocolate fondue is also the perfect way to end a romantic meal at home. The set up can be done way in advanced and the only thing you have to do later is turn on a little flame to get your own flame burning.\n\nUsing a fondue pot isn’t mandatory, but it does make it easier and adds a certain sense of class. If you are using a regular pot, once the chocolate is melted put an oven mitt down on the table and place the pot on top and begin to dip. The chocolate may cool rather quickly if it is in a regular pot. However if you are using a fondue pot, with a little flame underneath it, the chocolate will keep nice and warm, and melted much longer.\nAs for what to dip feel free to pick and choose; many people enjoy baked goods such as brownies, pound cake, marshmallows, and the ever lovely ladyfinger. Fresh fruit such as strawberries, pears, or bananas are always romantic and a bit healthier. And as always dried fruit such as apricots or large chunks of candied ginger make for a nice set-up.\n
913	Cream Cheese Frosting	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 With an electric mixer, mix the butter and cream cheese together, about 3 minutes on medium speed until very smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure even mixing.\n\n2 Add the vanilla extract and mix.  Slowly add the powdered sugar.  Keep adding until you  get to desired sweetness and thickness.\n\n3 Either spread on with a blunt knife or spatula, or spoon into a piping bag to decorate your cake or cupcake.\n\nVariations:\n\nAdding a teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice is always great for exotic chocolate cakes.\nAdding freshly ground ginger helps spice up a carrot cake. \nFreshly ground chai spice or even the contents of a bag of earl grey tea are heady and aromatic. \nThe scrapings from a vanilla bean can be very sweet and heavenly for red velvet or dark chocolate cakes.\nFreshly grated or dried, flaked coconut mixed in makes it perfect for a coconut cake. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Quick and easy cream cheese frosting brought to you by guest author Garrett McCord, the cupcake king. ~Elise\nCream cheese frosting is a baking basic. It’s perfect for practically any cake and any leftovers are great dolloped onto some freshly cut fruit. This is the basic recipe, you can reduce the amount of butter if you want a bit more tang, and increase or decrease the sugar according to your taste. Dress up with ginger, vanilla bean, or coconut flakes. I’ve listed some of my favorite variations at the end of the recipe. \n
914	How to Make Stock from Chicken Feet	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil.  Put the chicken feet into a large stock pot and cover with boiling water.  Boil for 5 minutes.  Use a large metal spoon to skim and discard the scum that rises to the surface.\n\n\n\n2 Drain the chicken feet completely.  Rinse with cold water so that the feet are cool enough to handle.  Using a sharp knife, chop off the tips of the claws and discard.  They should cut easily if you cut them through the joint. If any rough patches of claw pad remain, cut them away with a pairing knife.\n\n\n\n3 Place chicken feet in a clean large stockpot.  Fill with cold water to cover the feet by an inch.  Add carrots, onions, celery, thyme, bay leaf, and peppercorns.  Bring to a simmer, immediately reduce the temperature to low.  Partially cover, leave about a half inch crack or so, and keep the stock cooking at a bare simmer, for 4 hours.  Occasionally skim any foam that may come to the surface.  Uncover, increase the heat slightly to maintain a low simmer with the pot now uncovered.  Continue to cook for an hour or two.  At this point you are reducing the stock so that it is easier to store.  Strain the stock through several layers of cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer (ideally both) into a pot.  Pour into quart-sized jars.  Let cool for an hour or so before storing in the refrigerator.\n\n\nWhen your stock has cooled, it should firm up nicely into a gel.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recently my father announced that he missed chicken feet. (What?!) His mother, my grandmother who was born in 1899 and lived to the age of 97, used chicken feet when she made her stock and my dad could always tell when a soup had been made with stock from chicken feet. It has its own unique and wonderful flavor, and the added gelatin from the feet give whatever dish is made with the stock a luxurious feeling when eating it.\nThe “Eww” factor of chicken feet I think comes from the fact that chicken feet look a lot like our hands. Silly eh? Especially when we consider that making stock from chicken feet has been a human activity for thousands of years. Most of our grandmothers or great grandmothers used feet in their stock as a matter of fact. They would laugh at us today to see us cringe. Stock made from chicken feet is fabulous, and incredibly good for you with all that gelatin.\n \nAfter a lot of digging, I found a few old recipes. All recipes call for boiling the feet first, and then draining the boiling water. I think the point of this step is to get most of the extra protein and impurities to leave the feet and come to the surface. Another step that all the old recipes take is to cut off the claw tips. I’m not sure why, but I’m guessing that by cutting off the tips of the toes, it’s easier for the marrow and therefore the gelatin in the bones to come out. \nExpect to get a lot of stock out of the chicken feet. A pound of feet will yield about a quart of stock, pretty much a bargain at $1 a pound for feet. Where to find chicken feet? Probably the best place to look is in Chinese or Asian markets. In Sacramento, the best place to get chicken feet is at the American Poultry Company at 5th and Broadway.\n
915	Salsa Verde Carnitas	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Trim the excess fat from the pork shoulder roast. Put the roast, the salsa verde, onion, chicken stock, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and oregano in a large, thick-bottomed pot, and heat on high heat.  Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a low simmer.  Cover and simmer until meat pulls away easily with a fork, about 3 hours. \n\n2 Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove meat from liquid in pot and put the meat into a roasting pan. With 2 forks, tear the meat into large shreds, spreading them out in an even layer in the roasting pan. Roast meat for 15 to 20 minutes until parts are brown and crispy.\n\n3. While the meat is roasting, skim and discard fat from the liquid in the large pot. Heat the pot on high and vigorously boil the remaining liquid, stirring, until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n4 Return the meat to the pot with the liquid.  Stir in chopped cilantro. Season with salt.\n\n \n\nServe with heated and softened corn tortillas (20 seconds each in the microwave spread out over a paper towel will heat and softened packaged tortillas sufficiently), diced avocado, crumbed Cotija or grated Monterey jack cheese, sour cream (or crema fresca), and seasoned cabbage slaw.\n\nSeasoned Cabbage Slaw\n\nPlace thinly sliced cabbage in a medium sized bowl.  Sprinkle on olive oil, seasoned rice vinegar, salt and pepper.  You can substitute white vinegar or apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar, if you do, sprinkle on some sugar to help balance the acidity of the vinegar.  Toss.  Adjust seasonings.  Let sit for 10 minutes for the cabbage to absorb some of the dressing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Carnitas are the Mexican version of pulled pork. Braised first in a spicy sauce, pork shoulder is slow cooked until so tender the meat just shreds easily with a fork, then it’s roasted at high heat to make crispy browned bits full of flavor. It’s taco meat, burrito meat, or just stewy meat served with rice and beans. This version of carnitas, adapted from a Sunset recipe for braised pork, is cooked first in a braise of tomatilla salsa verde, or green salsa. It’s delicious served with fresh corn tortillas and topped with a shredded cabbage slaw, Cotija cheese, avocado, and Mexican sour cream.\n
916	Penne Pasta with Meat Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat to boiling a large pot with 4 quarts of water in it. Once the water is boiling, salt it with 2 Tbsp of salt. Once the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. Leave uncovered, let cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm). Drain.\n\n2 Once you've started to heat the water, start working on the sauce. Heat olive oil in a very large skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened. Add the garlic, fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional minute, until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n3 Heat a large cast iron pan on high heat. Salt the bottom of the pan generously. Once the pan is hot, break up small chunks of ground beef and add them to the pan, without stirring. (You may need to work in batches; do not crowd the pan.) You want the meat to get well browned. If the pan is too hot and the meat is burning, not browning, take the pan off the heat for a little, and reduce the heat to medium high. On our coil electric stove, it takes the high heat setting for the meat to brown sufficiently, but your stove may be different. Once the meat is browned on one side (a couple of minutes), use a metal spatula to flip the meat over to brown on the other side. At this point, assuming you are using a cast iron pan, you can remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the meat.\n\n4 Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat from the cast iron pan and add it to the pan with the seasoned onions. Add tomato sauce. Use the edge of your metal spatula to break up the bigger chunks of meat into smaller pieces. Add basil. Add a teaspoon of sugar. Bring to a simmer on low heat, let cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes.\n\n5 Once the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, adjust seasonings. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too acidic. Add more tomato sauce if the sauce is a little dry. Stir in the cooked penne pasta. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My mother made a pasta dish the other night that took everyone by surprise. My skinny-as-a-spatula 10-year old nephew who won’t eat anything, ate his serving with gusto and asked for more. My carb-avoiding sister couldn’t resist it. My father declared it a triumph. Later that night dad had my mom recount to him exactly what she did to make it. Thank goodness, because experience has shown that my mother’s memory for recipes has a half-life of only a few hours. Sure enough when we asked her to make it again a few days later (so we could get a good photo for this post) she had a hard time recalling the details. Diligent dad supplied a few notes and it all came back to her.\nThe main trick to this recipe? Sufficiently browning the meat. Which means using a cast iron frying pan on high heat, letting the ground beef cook in its own fat, and not stirring it, so that the meat has a chance to brown well.\n
917	How to Make Butterscotch	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tButterscotch takes about a half an hour to make, from start to finish.\n\n1 First, before you begin, make sure you have everything ready to go - the cream and the brown sugar next to the pan, measured and waiting. Making butterscotch is a fast process that cannot wait for hunting around for ingredients.\n\n2 In a heavy bottomed stainless steel 2 quart saucepan, melt butter over low to medium heat. Just before butter is melted, add all dark brown sugar at once and stir with wooden spoon until sugar is uniformly wet.\n\n\n\n3 Stir infrequently until mixture goes from looking grainy to molten lava.  Make sure to get into the corners of your pot, and watch closely to notice how the mixture changes. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes. \n\n\n\n4 Right before you add the cream, the caramelizing brown sugar will begin to look and feel more like liquid and less like thick wet sand. \n\n5 At this point add all the cream at once and replace your spoon with a whisk. Lower heat a little and whisk cream into mixture. When liquid is uniform, turn heat back to medium and whisk every few minutes for a total of 10 minutes. \n\n\n\n6 After liquid has been boiling on the stove for its 10 minutes, turn heat off and let rest for a minute or two before transferring into a heatproof storage vessel. (I prefer a stainless steel or glass bowl.) Cool to room temperature.\n\n\n\n7 When butterscotch liquid is room temperature, take a small taste. It's important to know what cooked brown sugar and butter tastes like, and what happens when transforming that flat sweetness into real butterscotch flavor. Whisk in half the salt and vanilla extract. Taste again. Add more salt and vanilla extract until the marvelous taste of real butterscotch is achieved.\n\n\n\nButterscotch makes a fantastic topping for ice cream. \n\nChill butterscotch sauce in a non-reactive container with a tightly fitting lid only after sauce has chilled completely. It will keep for one month refrigerated, that is if you can keep from eating it all the moment it has cooled down and been seasoned to your liking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author pastry chef Shuna Fish Lydon of Eggbeater who shares with us the (almost) lost art of making butterscotch. ~Elise\nWhen was the last time you tasted authentic butterscotch? Flavor, sauce, memory, aroma, era: butterscotch was an all but extinct, or out-of-date substance, and flavor until recently. Now it’s all the rage.\nWouldn’t you like to know exactly what butterscotch is and how to make it?\n \nHistorically, butterscotch was a hard candy made with unprocessed sugar. The suffix “scotch” means “to cut”. When sugar or candy is hot it’s difficult to get a clean break, so one must score it while warm to facilitate getting a clean edge later.\nToday butterscotch is considered a flavor, much like caramel. Made famous at soda fountains by accompanying banana splits, butterscotch sauce has been an American favorite since the 1950′s. \nAlthough most Americans are familiar with butterscotch pudding, in recent years what’s been readily available is an artificially flavored shadow real butterscotch flavor. My hope is that once you see how easy butterscotch is to make, you’ll never go back to the imposter.\n
918	Smoked Salmon and Gruyere Grilled Cheese Sandwich	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 In a small saucepan bring 1 cup of water to a boil.  Add a half teaspoon of salt.  When the salt has dissolved, add the slices of lemon to the pan, layering them down flat in the pan.  Let water boil away until it is almost all gone and there is just a thin syrup left in the pan.  Do not stir while cooking.  Remove from heat.\n\n2 Heat a large cast iron pan on medium high heat.  While the pan is heating, arrange the sandwiches (next step).\n\n2 Lay out 4 slices of bread.  On top of them layer slices of smoked salmon, cheese, and chives.  Use a fork to lift the lemon slices out of the pan and add one large lemon slice to each sandwich.  Top with a second layer of bread.  \n\n3 Butter the top bread slices generously with butter.  Once the pan is hot, place the sandwiches in the pan, butter side down.  Lower the heat to medium.  Let cook for a few minutes until the bottom of the sandwiches are well toasted.\n\n\n\n4 Butter the top side of the sandwiches in the pan.  Use a metal spatula to flip the sandwiches over.  Press down on the sandwiches with the metal spatula.  Let cook until the bottom of the sandwiches is nicely browned.  If the cheese isn't melting, turn the heat to low, cover the pan and let cook for a few minutes more.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Many moons ago my friend Dennis Kercher shared with me his favorite grilled cheese sandwich – one with smoked salmon, Gruyere, and lemon confit made from preserved lemons. I finally got around to making this fabulous sandwich, but instead of using preserved lemons (most people don’t have those sitting around), I boiled Meyer lemon slices down in salted water. Very tasty, and a great way to use up any smoked salmon left over from a weekend brunch.\n
919	Shrimp and Artichoke Pasta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat to boiling a large pot with at least 4 quarts of water in it. Once the water is boiling, salt it with 1 Tbsp of salt for every 4 quarts of water. Once the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. Leave uncovered, let cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm).\n\n2 Once the pasta is done, and before draining the pasta, scoop out one cup of the pasta cooking liquid and reserve. Drain the pasta. Toss the pasta with the pesto and keep it warm.\n\n3 Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and shrimp and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the shrimp is just pink.  Add the peas and artichokes, lower the heat to medium, cover and cook for an additional minute. Add the green onions and parsley, reduce the heat to low.  Add the pasta and about a third of a cup of the reserved cooking water.  Toss to coat evenly.  Add more cooking water if the pasta is still a little too dry.\n\nSeason with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Okay, pardon me in advance, but I think I’ve just had a Sandra Lee moment with this dish. Wait, the parsley is fresh from the garden, does that count? Let’s look at the ingredients – shrimp (best to get frozen and defrost yourself, unless you can get fresh, because most of what you buy in the store is “previously frozen” anyway), artichoke hearts (frozen, I would rather eat fresh artichokes whole), peas (frozen, they’re good!), basil pesto (not in season, but I make mine in the summer and freeze it, add Parmesan back to it when I use it), and pasta (from a box, I guess you could get fresh or make it yourself), onion greens and garlic from the farmers market, and parsley (redemption).\nA great weeknight pasta dish assuming your freezer is well stocked. ;-)\n
920	Asparagus Soufflé	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Blanch asparagus for 2 minutes in boiling salted water (1 teaspoon of salt for every quart of water).  Drain.  Rinse in cold water to stop cooking.  Set aside to let cool.\n\n2 Melt 1 Tbsp butter in saucepan on medium heat.  Add shallots, garlic, and thyme.  Cook gently until soft, do not let brown.  About 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.\n\n3 Purée asparagus and shallot mixture in a blender.  Measure out 1 1/4 cup of purée.  \n\n4 Butter 6 8-ounce ramekins.  Coat well with the bread crumbs, reserving any leftover bread crumbs.\n\n5 Make a thick béchamel sauce.  Over medium-low heat, melt 3 Tbsp butter in a medium sized saucepan.  Add the cake flour and whisk to completely incorporate the flour into the butter, continue to stir for a couple of minutes.  Do not let brown.  Very slowly, add the milk to the mixture, little by little, whisking constantly.  Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the nutmeg, cumin, mustard, ginger, and some fresh ground black pepper.  Lower the heat to low and let cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the mixture from sticking to the pan.\n\n6 After 15 minutes, remove the béchamel from the heat and stir in the cheese.  Transfer the béchamel and the asparagus mixture to a large mixing bowl (if you have a mixing bowl with a pour lip on the side, use it,  it will make it easier to pour out later).  Taste the mixture and adjust the seasonings.  The souffle base should be well-seasoned.  Stir in the egg yolks until well combined.\n\nAt this point you can make ahead the souffle mixture. Refrigerate to store for up to two days.  Return to room temperature before proceeding.\n\n7 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n\n8 Prepare to make a water bath (a bain marie).  Have ready a 9x12 baking dish with at least 2 inch sides.  Put on a kettle of water to boil.\n\n\n\n9 Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites and using a mixer, beat the egg whites to firm but soft, almost stiff, peaks. (Make sure there are no traces of egg yolk or shell in your egg whites before starting.)  Do not over-beat.  Over-beating results in stiff peaks that are dry, somewhat reminiscent of styrofoam.  Use a rubber spatula to first fold in one quarter of the beaten egg whites into the asparagus mixture, then the remaining three-quarters.  Use a light touch to keep from deflating the egg whites.\n\n\n\n10 Fill ramekins with the mixture up to a quarter-inch from the top.  If you want, sprinkle leftover bread crumbs on top.  Place the ramekins in the bain marie baking dish.  Place baking dish on the middle rack in the oven.  Pour boiling water into the baking dish around the ramekins until the water comes up halfway the sides of the ramekins. \n\n\n\n11 Bake for 10 minutes at 400°F, reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for about 15 minutes more, until puffed up and golden brown.  Don't open the oven door until the soufflé is just about done, or it may fall.\n\nYou can serve the soufflés immediately or you can serve them later.  To proceed for serving them later, let the soufflés sit in the bain marie for 15 minutes.  Then use run a sharp knife around the edges and invert the individual soufflés to a buttered baking sheet.  Cool to room temperature, wrap in plastic and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Return to room temperature before re-baking.  Heat oven to 400°F, bake the souffles on a buttered baking sheet, not in ramekins, for 7-8 minutes, and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever attempted to make a soufflé and it just didn’t live up to your expectations? That’s when it pays to have friends who actually know what they are doing. After trying unsuccessfully to recreate a fabulous soufflé I enjoyed at a brunch given by chef, and fellow food blogger, Brett of In Praise of Sardines I broke down and asked him for help. Thank goodness for talented friends who are generous with their advice!\nHere is what Brett had to say when I asked him for some tips to making my soufflé light and fluffy:\n \n Butter the ramekins thoroughly, then coat with very fine breadcrumbs.\n Use cake flour instead of all purpose in the bechamel.\n Use extra egg whites. Whip them to soft peaks that are dancing on the edge of becoming stiff peaks.\n Work quickly and fold with a light touch.\nBrett also shared his soufflé recipe (see his butternut squash pudding soufflé) with me which I fiddled with a bit, incorporating some ideas that seemed to work from my other soufflé endeavors, which I share with you now. Note that soufflés really are a bit tricky to make; this is not a beginner recipe. But if you are confident with your egg white whipping and folding skills, you should have no problem with this one. \nWhat I love about Brett’s approach is that you can actually make these soufflés in advance, which is perfect for a brunch gathering or a party in which you want to have most of the cooking done ahead of time. We ate half of them right out of the oven, and we re-baked the other half for a later meal. Both sets were delicious.\n
921	Blondies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter and flour an 8X8 pan. Whisk together the melted butter and sugar in a bowl.\n\n2 Add the egg and vanilla extract and whisk.\n\n3 Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, mix it all together. Add the butterscotch chips or other mix-ins.\n\n4 Pour into the pan and spread evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool. Cut into squares and serve. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Simply Recipes guest author Garrett McCord who shares with us his favorite blondie recipe.\nBlondies are often called brownies without chocolate which I find silly; blondies are a dessert with their own unique deliciousness and personality. Whereas brownies depend on chocolate for their flavor, for blondies it’s all about the brown sugar, giving the blondies their distinctive molasses flavor. Chewy, rich, and flavorful blondies, when made right, are an indulgent dessert that are hard to resist.\nThis is my “go-to” dessert recipe since it only takes about 5 minutes to make and then throw in the oven. I can’t count how many times I dashed this together so that last second company could arrive to a freshly baked treat. Plus, it only makes a small batch, so you don’t have to worry about being tempted by dozens of tasty treats lying in wait for you.\n \nSince brown sugar is the critical flavor here, I suggest using dark brown sugar. While butterscotch chips or walnuts are commonly mixed in, chocolate chips are equally good. And of course, blondies should always be served with a glass of milk.\n
922	Oatmeal Raisin Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two large cookie sheets or line with Silpat, parchment paper or waxed paper.\n\n2 In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until creamy. Add sugars; beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs. Add vanilla.\n\n3 Mix flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in medium bowl.  Stir dry ingredients into butter-sugar mixture. Stir in raisins and nuts.  Stir in oats.\n\n4 Spoon out dough by large tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie. \n\n5 Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, 10-12 minutes. Cool 1 minute on cookie sheets. Then carefully remove them, using a metal spatula, to a wire rack. Cool completely. They will be quite soft until completely cooled. Store tightly covered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	So, my favorite cookies in the whole wide world are these oatmeal raisin cookies. Could be because my grandmother used to bake them with me when I was little. I got to lick the bowl (they don’t let kids do that any more because of the raw eggs, a shame), a privilege we kids fought over. Whoever helped with the cooking got first dibs, so guess who was the first to volunteer to help?\n
923	Irish Soda Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 425°. Whisk together 4 cups of flour, the sugar, salt, and baking soda into a large mixing bowl.\n2 Using your (clean) fingers (or two knives or a pastry cutter), work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal, then add in the currants or raisins.\n\n3 Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add beaten egg and buttermilk to well and mix in with a wooden spoon until dough is too stiff to stir. Dust hands with a little flour, then gently knead dough in the bowl just long enough to form a rough ball. If the dough is too sticky to work with, add in a little more flour. Do not over-knead! Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and shape into a round loaf. Note that the dough will be a little sticky, and quite shaggy (a little like a shortcake biscuit dough). You want to work it just enough so that the flour is just moistened and the dough just barely comes together. Shaggy is good. If you over-knead, the bread will end up tough.\n\n4 Transfer dough to a large, lightly greased cast-iron skillet or a baking sheet (it will flatten out a bit in the pan or on the baking sheet). Using a serrated knife, score top of dough about an inch and a half deep in an "X" shape. The purpose of the scoring is to help heat get into the center of the dough while it cooks. Transfer to oven and bake until bread is golden and bottom sounds hollow when tapped, about 35-45 minutes. (If you use a cast iron pan, it may take a little longer as it takes longer for the pan to heat up than a baking sheet.) Check for doneness also by inserting a long, thin skewer into the center. If it comes out clean, it's done.\nHint 1: If the top is getting too dark while baking, tent the bread with some aluminum foil.\nHint 2: If you use a cast iron skillet to cook the bread in the oven, be very careful when you take the pan out. It's easy to forget that the handle is extremely hot. Cool the handle with an ice cube, or put a pot holder over it.\nRemove pan or sheet from oven, let bread sit in the pan or on the sheet for 5-10 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool briefly. Serve bread warm, at room temperature, or sliced and toasted. Best when eaten warm and just baked.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Around ten years ago I took a vacation in Ireland, spending days driving in and around Western Ireland. I still have vivid memories of bright green hills, muddy bogs, sheep with the scariest eyes, massive downpours, happy raucous pubs, learning to sing Dona Nobis Pachem in round, the freshest cream imaginable, and heavenly Irish bread that seemed to accompany almost every meal.\nIt appears everyone has their favorite Irish soda bread recipe. Some with caraway seeds, some with raisins, some with both, some with neither. The essential ingredients in a traditional Irish soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The acid in buttermilk reacts with the base of the baking soda to provide the bread’s leavening. This soda bread is a slightly fancied up version of the Irish classic, with a little butter, sugar, an egg, and some currants or raisins added to the base. Note that soda bread dries out quickly so is only good for a day or two. It is best eaten freshly baked and warm or toasted.\n
924	New England Boiled Dinner	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.  If you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.  If using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.  Bring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering.  Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n\n2 Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm.  Add the vegetables to the pot.  Check the broth for taste.  If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.  Raise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer.  Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice the meat in thin slices against the grain.  You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths against the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth.  Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	New England boiled dinner is a one pot dish consisting of corned beef or plain beef brisket or smoked picnic ham shoulder, with cabbage, carrots and potatoes. When made with corned beef, it’s an Irish-American corned beef and cabbage dish, traditionally made around St. Patrick’s Day. My parents like to make it with plain, uncured brisket. Others make it with smoked ham shoulder. The following recipe is for boiled dinner made with either corned beef or plain beef brisket.\n
925	Pasta with Tuna, Arugula, and Hot Pepper	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and boil until al dente.\n\n\n\n2 While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium-low heat.  Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant and sizzling. Add tuna and shred it into fine flakes with a fork. Season with salt. Keep warm over low heat.\n\n3 Just before the pasta is ready, set aside 1 cup of boiling water. Drain pasta and return it to the warm pot set over moderate heat. Depending on the size of your pot and skillet, either add the arugula and the tuna mixture to the pasta in the pasta pot, or add the drained pasta to the skillet with the tuna mixture and add the arugula.  Toss vigorously with tongs, moistening with some of the reserved pasta water. The arugula will wilt in the heat of the pasta. Divide among warm bowls and serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Canned tuna has never tasted this good. I came across this recipe on Sher’s What did you eat? blog, where she got it from the San Francisco Chronicle. You make a sauce for the pasta with tuna, olive oil, garlic, and chile pepper flakes. When the pasta is done mix it in with the sauce and add fresh arugula which will wilt with the heat of the sauce and pasta. If you don’t have arugula, you can probably substitute fresh spinach to a similar effect. Quick, easy, and surprisingly delicious.\n \nThe recipe calls for tuna packed in olive oil. This is pretty important. If all you have is tuna packed in water, drain the tuna and let it soak in olive oil for an hour before using.\n
926	Home Fries	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHome fries made with raw potatoes\n\n1 Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a medium to large skillet on medium high heat until sizzling.  Place a single layer of potato slices on the bottom of the pan.  Add a light layer of sliced onions.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Add another layer of potatoes, another layer of onion slices, sprinkle again with salt and pepper.  Keep layering until you've used up your potatoes and onions.\n\n\n\n2 Lower the heat to medium and cover the pan.  Let cook for about 10 minutes, until the potato layer at the bottom is nicely browned.  You can move aside a little bit with a fork to see if the bottom edges are browned.\n\n\n\n3 Gently flip the potatoes over, a section of the pan at a time, so that the layer that was on the top is now on the bottom, and the browned potatoes are now on the top.  Add another Tbsp of oil. The oil will help the browning. Cover and let cook for another 5-10 minutes, until the bottom layer is now browned. \n\n\n\n4 Once the bottom layer is browned, remove the lid of the pan and let continue to cook for 5 more minutes.  This additional cooking will help the potatoes dry out just a little bit more.\n\nServe immediately.  Serves 2-4.\n\nHome fries made with cooked potatoes\n\n\n\n1 Cut the cooked potatoes into 1/2-inch slices.  Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a medium to large skillet on medium high heat until sizzling.  Add sliced onions to pan and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\n\n\n2 Add the potato pieces, spread out as much as possible along the bottom of the pan.  Sprinkle generously with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, without stirring (about 7-8 minutes).   Add 1 Tbsp bacon fat, or more oil to the pan.   Gently flip the potatoes and cook until the bottom of the flipped potatoes are nicely browned.\n\nServe immediately.  Serves 2-4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We had dueling home fries here the other day, a veritable home-fry cook-off between my mother and father. Mom makes her fried potatoes sliced, using raw potatoes, and usually serves them as a side when we have fish for dinner. Dad makes his home fries for breakfast using leftover boiled potatoes from the night before. Both are great. The raw potatoes tend to brown up better. The cooked potatoes can get a little mushy if you stir them too much. You can easily dress up them up with bell peppers, ham, or bacon. And if you add some egg, you get German farmer’s breakfast.\nHow do you like your home fries?\n
927	Irish Lamb Stew with a Twist	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large (6-quart), thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium heat.  Layer the bacon on the bottom of the pan and cook the slices gently, a few minutes on each side, until much of the fat has been rendered out, and the slices have browned lightly. Place the cooked bacon strips on a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb the excess fat. Chop the bacon and set aside.\n\n2 Remove all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat from the pan (do not pour the removed fat down the drain or it will clog the drain pipes).  Increase the heat to medium high.  Working in batches as to not crowd the pan, brown the lamb pieces on all sides, taking care not to stir the lamb pieces so they can get sufficiently browned.  \n\n\n\n3 Arrange the meat and vegetables in the pan in layers.  Start first with a layer of lamb, then add a layer of potatoes, onions, turnips, carrots, and chopped bacon.  Add another layer of lamb and then another of vegetables.  Add the barley, thyme, black pepper and a teaspoon of salt. Add water or stock to the pot, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a bare simmer.  Let simmer, covered, but with the lid slightly ajar, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the meat is fork tender and falling off the bones.\n\n3 Skim any excess fat from the stew.  Use tongs to pick out and remove bones.  Adjust seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Around St. Patrick’s Day I notice many people coming to this site looking for an Irish lamb stew recipe. After some experimentation and a lot of research into Irish stews, I’ve settled on a stew that has its roots in the traditional approach, but takes a few detours to add a bit more flavor. \nTraditionally, Irish stew is made with mature lamb (year old) or mutton, potatoes, onions, and water, and is simply cooked low and slow. Where we make embellishments with this recipe is that we work with lamb shoulder, the meat is browned first, in bacon fat, and carrots, bacon, and thyme are all added. All of these steps are to bring a richer flavor to the stew. (If you want, you can skip any or all of these additions.)\n
984	Mom’s Warm Potato Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put potatoes into a saucepan, cover with an inch of cold water.  Salt the water (about a teaspoon and a half for 2 quarts of water).  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer. Cover.  Simmer for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.  Drain well.\n\n2 Put potatoes in a large serving bowl with the celery, red onion, olives, and parsley.  Add the rice vinegar and oil while the potatoes are still warm, so they absorb the dressing.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Adjust vinegar and oil to taste.\n\nServe warm.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I don’t know about you, but summer around here has us making potato salads more often than in other seasons. This is the latest one my mother put together; my father has made her make it several times since, and my brothers have devoured it with raves for mom. No mayo, just a simple rice vinegar olive oil dressing.\n
928	Arroz Con Pollo	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 3 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet (a skillet that has a cover) on medium high heat.  Put the flour in a wide bowl, mix in a generous sprinkling of salt, pepper, and paprika.  Dredge the chicken pieces lightly in the flour mixture and put in the pan to brown.  (You can skip the flour dredging part if you want.  It just makes a nicer coating for the chicken.)  Cook a few minutes on each side, just enough so that the chicken has browned.  Use a slotted spoon to remove from pan and set aside.\n\n2 Add the rice to the pan to brown.  Add a little more olive oil if necessary.  Stir first to coat the rice with the olive oil in the pan.  Then don't stir too much or you will prevent it from browning.  Let it brown and then stir a little to let more of it brown.  Then add the onion and garlic.  Cook the onion, garlic and rice mixture, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened, about 4 minutes.\n\n3 Place the chicken pieces, skin-side up, on top of the rice.  In a separate bowl, mix together the stock, tomato, salt, and oregano.  Pour the stock mixture over the rice and chicken.  Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and cover.  Let cook for 20-25 minutes, depending on the type of rice and the instructions on the rice package, until the rice and chicken are done.  Fluff the rice with a fork.  If you want you can sprinkle with some peas.  Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Arroz con pollo means “Rice with Chicken” in Spanish. It is a classic dish of Spain and Latin America, with many different traditional ways to prepare it, unique to various countries. An arroz con pollo you find in Cuba may be quite different than one you find in Peru. Please read the comments at the end of this recipe to see some wonderful classic versions of this dish. What follows is my mother’s basic arroz con pollo recipe, which she adjusts depending on her mood and what she has on hand. For instance, she might substitute chipotle chile powder or red chile powder for the paprika. We never use saffron in our arroz con pollo, but many people do. You can also add chopped bell peppers (cook with the onions) or peas (mix in at the end). It’s an easy, stove-top, one pan dish, great for family meals.\n
929	Candied Kumquats	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 With a pairing knife roughly chop the kumquats. Discard any seeds you can that are easy to get too, but they're edible so don't fret if some get chopped up or stay in the fruit. Feel free to leave any small kumquats whole.\n\n2 Heat the water and sugar over high heat until it comes to a boil. Simmer for 4 minutes. Add the kumquats and simmer for 10 minutes.\n\n3 Drain the kumquats through a sieve set over a bowl. Return the syrup to the pan and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the syrup. Combine the kumquats and 1/4 cup of the syrup together. \n\nServe or jar and refrigerate. Can be stored for up to two weeks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	It’s raining kumquats. Literally. My pal and neighbor Garrett found a fully loaded kumquat tree on his campus and now we are quite flush with them. A few days ago Garrett brought a jar of these candied kumquats over and we’ve been nibbling on them ever since. Ridiculously easy to make, candied kumquats are half condiment, half candy. You can use them on salads, pork, chicken, cheesecakes, or even with chocolate ice cream. Or you can do what I do, which is to sneak a couple out of the fridge and just eat them straight. Sticky gooey goodness.\n
930	Smoked Salmon Pasta	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat to boiling a large pot with at least 4 quarts of salted water in it. (2 Tbsp of salt for 4 quarts of water.) While the water is heating, brown the pine nuts. Put the pine nuts in a single layer in a large skillet. Heat on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly browned. Remove pine nuts from pan and set aside.\n2 Once the water is boiling, add the pasta to the pot. Cook uncovered on high heat at a rolling boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm).\n3 While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a large skillet heat olive oil on medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, cook for 2 minutes, then add white wine, lemon juice, and 1 Tbsp of lemon zest. Increase the heat and let boil down by half. If you want a slightly creamy sauce, add the cream and let boil a minute more.\nThe sauce should be done about the same time the pasta is done. If you get done earlier with it than the pasta, take it off the heat.\n4 Once the pasta is done, and before draining the pasta, scoop out one cup of the pasta cooking liquid and reserve. Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the sauce. Add back some of the pasta cooking liquid to the pasta if it is a little dry. Add the smoked salmon, toasted pine nuts, parsley, and the remaining lemon zest. Season with freshly ground black pepper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What I love about this recipe, other than the ingredients (smoked salmon, pine nuts, yum!) is that it can be pulled together so quickly and it’s not particularly heavy, as so many cream sauce pastas can be. There’s also room for maneuvering; add more or less wine or cream to taste; leave out the pine nuts if you can’t be bothered; add some asparagus or cream cheese if you want; use smoked trout or sturgeon instead of the salmon. The essentials are smoked fish, lemon, garlic, and pasta with some olive oil, wine, and or cream binding them together.\n
931	Turkey and Bacon Rolls	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 375°F.  Place each cutlet on a piece of aluminum foil (about 5x6 inches).  Sprinkle each cutlet with salt, pepper, garlic, and basil.\n\n\n\n2 Layer a slice of cheese and a couple slices of ham on to each cutlet.  Starting with the narrowest end, roll up the cutlet tightly.  Gently wrap 2 slices of bacon around each cutlet.  Fold up the aluminum foil around the turkey roll and wrap it tightly.\n\n\n\n3 Place in a baking dish and put in the 375°F for 25 minutes.  Remove from oven and gently open up the aluminum foil wrappings to expose the bacon.  Increase the oven temp to 400°F.  Cook for an additional 10-15 minutes until the bacon is lightly browned.\n\nServe immediately.  Serve alone or with rice, or pan-fried vegetables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Wandering around the web the other day, I encountered this recipe for gorgeous looking rocamboles de volaille, basically a poultry roll, on a French-language website about Portuguese food. In Brazil apparently rolled foods are called “rocamboles”; if there are Brazilians in our midst, please correct me if this isn’t so. This particular roll starts with a thin turkey breast cutlet, to which layers of Provolone cheese and ham are added. The cutlet is rolled up tight, wrapped in bacon, and baked until done. It reminds us a lot of our favorite chicken bacon roulades recipe, but easier to make, and with turkey cutlets.\n
947	Kohlrabi Ham Bake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F.  In a large skillet, melt the butter on medium heat.  Add the diced kohlrabi and gently cook for 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n2 Beat the egg yolk, and whisk in the heavy cream, flour, mace, salt and pepper until well combined.\n\n3 Place half of the cooked kohlrabi on the bottom of an oven-proof casserole dish.  Layer on the diced ham and parsley.  Top with the remaining kohlrabi.  Pour the sauce ingredients over the kohlrabi and ham.\n\n4 Bake for 30-35 minutes or until lightly browned on top.  Serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	If I could, I would reach out to each and every one of you, take you by the hand to the market, buy a bunch of kohlrabi and some ham, go back to your kitchen with you and make this dish for you. Just so you would try it. It’s that good. The recipe was in a book that Garrett gave my father on Russian, German & Polish Food & Cooking. Dad has a preternatural affection for all things turnip and cabbage. Kohlrabi means cabbage turnip in German, so of course dad couldn’t wait to try the recipe. We all loved it so much we made him make it again a few days later and made sure my brother showed up for dinner.\n
932	Asparagus Risotto	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 In a 3 or 4 quart saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon butter on medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for a minute or two, until translucent. Add the rice and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring until nicely coated.\n\n2 While the shallots are cooking, bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan.\n\n\n\n3 Add the wine.  Slowly stir, allowing the rice to absorb the wine.  Once the wine is almost completely absorbed, add 1/2 cup of hot stock to the rice.  Continue to stir until the liquid is almost completely absorbed, adding more stock in 1/2 cup increments.  Stir often to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Continue cooking and stirring rice, adding a little bit of broth at a time, cooking and stirring until it is absorbed, until the rice is tender, but still firm to the bite, about 20-25 minutes.  With the last ladle of stock, add the asparagus. Turn off the heat.\n\nNote the stock amount given is approximate.  You may need a little more or less.  If you end up needing more stock and you find yourself without, just use water.\n\n4 Gently stir in the Parmesan cheese and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	In California winter can transition to spring in a flash. It seems like yesterday we were beset by chilly storms while the forecast for this week is all sunny and 70s. Daffodils are blooming, as are cherry trees, and the truest test of spring, asparagus in the market can be found for less than $2 a pound. I just couldn’t resist these at the market today, and cooked them up into a creamy risotto. This recipe is a a classic asparagus risotto recipe. You can easily dress it up with some lemon zest, lump crab meat, green onions, truffle salt, fresh thyme or chopped mint.\n \n\n
933	Banana Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg and continue to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.\n\n2 In a bowl, mix the mashed bananas and baking soda.  Let sit for 2 minutes. The baking soda will react with the acid in the bananas which in turn will give the cookies their lift and rise.\n\n3 Mix the banana mixture into the butter mixture. Mix together the flour, salt, and spices and sift into the butter and banana mixture and mix until just combined.\n\n4 Fold into the batter the pecans or chocolate chips if using. Drop in dollops onto parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 11-13 minutes or until nicely golden brown. Let cool on wire racks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This banana cookie recipe came from my grandmother, Sybil Capune; she was a spry woman who made me fresh orange juice in the mornings, loved her toast burnt, and was an amazing home cook. When I inherited her recipe boxes, each filled with yellowed hand-typed note cards, I began exploring my family’s culinary history. This particular recipe, now about 70 years old, is one of the best in the bunch and has become one of my favorite cookie recipes ever.\n \nThese banana cookies are what I consider to be a staple for any home. Who hasn’t had plenty of instances where some bananas have gotten a bit overripe? Banana bread and banana nut muffins aren’t the only way to use up ripe bananas, and these cake-like cookies are a great new alternative. With a fresh banana taste and enhanced with spices and pecans they’re a perfect treat for any brown paper bag lunch. \nSo good, I guarantee they won’t last long.\n
934	Chile Relleno Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Preheat broiler. Lay chiles in a single layer on a broiling pan (not a baking sheet that will warp in the heat of the broiler) or on a rack in a roasting pan.  Position the the chilies one to two inches from the broiler element. Cook  until chiles are blistering and black, a few minutes on all sides.  Turn chiles over and broil until blistering and black all over. Alternatively, you can blacken the chilies directly over a gas burner.  Put chilies in a paper bag or thick plastic bag. Let sit 15 minutes.\n\n2  While the chilies are cooling, heat olive oil in a large sautée pan, on medium.  Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for a minute more.  Add the tomatoes (break up any whole tomatoes before adding to the pan).  Add a pinch of salt.  Bring to a simmer and lower the heat to low.  Gently simmer for 15-20 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n\n\n3 Carefully peel and discard the blackened skin off of the chilies. Cut off the stem ends, remove the seeds and discard. Set chiles aside on a layer of paper towels to dry.\n\n4 In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, cook chorizo, stirring occasionally to break up the meat, until cooked through, about 4 minutes.\n\n5 Preheat oven to 375°.  Pour tomato sauce into the bottom of an 8x12 inch baking dish (the tomato sauce should be the consistency of a thin spaghetti sauce.   If it is too thick, thin it out with a little water). \n\n\n\n6 In a large bowl, mix chorizo, cotija, and oregano. Stuff chiles with sausage mixture and lay them on top of the tomato sauce in the pan.\n\n7 In a large bowl, whisk the eggs thoroughly. Whisk in the flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Sprinkle chiles with half of the jack or cheddar cheese. Pour egg mixture over chiles and sprinkle with remaining cheese.\n\n8 Bake until top starts to brown and the eggs are set but still soft, about 30 minutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Classic chiles rellenos are green chiles, blackened and outer skin removed, stuffed with either cheese or a pork sausage picadillo, dipped in batter, fried in oil, and often served with a thin tomato sauce. I grew up loving the chiles rellenos my mother made for us. The only problem is that they are a bit tricky to make; they can sometimes get soggy with the oil. And they can be a bit rich with all that frying. This recipe for a chile relleno casserole skips the steps of dipping in batter and frying, and instead bakes the stuffed chiles in an egg batter. The recipe is based on one from Sunset Magazine; our main adjustment to the original is to include a tomato sauce base to the casserole. To us, chiles rellenos just taste better with a light tomato sauce, and they do in this casserole as well.\n
935	Mustard Greens	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large sauté pan, sauté onions in olive oil over medium heat until the onions begin to brown and caramelize, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook a minute more, until fragrant.\n2 Add the mustard greens and broth and cook until the mustard greens are just barely wilted. Toss with sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever tried mustard greens? Related to kale, cabbage, and collard greens, they are the peppery leafy greens of the mustard plant and are used frequently in Chinese, Japanese, and Indian cooking. I find them less bitter than kale or collard greens, and more peppery, like arugula. Just one taste of a raw leaf and you’ll know it came from a mustard plant. Cooked, they taste a lot like spinach, but with more body. My father recently discovered mustard greens at our local farmers market and they’re his new love. I like them with a dash of dark sesame oil, but you could easily just cook them up with a little garlic and olive oil.\nDo you have a favorite way to prepare mustard greens? Please let us know about it in the comments.\n
936	Lemon Tart	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCandied Citrus Zest\n\n1 Place lemon zest in a saucepan and cover with water by 1/2 inch.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat, drain the water.  Fill up with water again and repeat.  Bring to a boil, remove from heat, then drain.  Add water again, this time adding the sugar as well.  Simmer for 30 minutes, drain.\n\n2 Spread the zest out on a sheet of parchment paper.  Let dry overnight at room temperature (do not put in the refrigerator).  The next day toss the zest with a little more sugar.\n\nMake the Crust\n\n\n\n3 Combine flour, salt, butter, and sugar in a bowl. Use a pastry blender, or two blunt dinner knives, to cut the butter into the flour until the dough forms flaky crumbs and lumps. You can also just mix with your fingers. With a wooden spoon, mix in the egg, almond extract, and lemon juice. Continue to mix until the dough clumps; at first it may seem very dry. Shape into a ball, flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic, refrigerate at least an hour.\n\n4 Pre-heat oven to 350°F.5 Let the dough sit at temperature for at least 10-15 minutes before attempting to work with it. Allow the dough to relax enough to become somewhat pliable before rolling out. Roll out the disk between two sheets of parchment paper (or wax paper), to a circle 2 inches larger in diameter than your tart pan (about a 12-inch round).\n\n\n\n6 Press the dough into the tart pan.  Use your rolling pin to level the  dough along the edges of the pan.  Place aluminum foil over the foil and gently mold it to the dough in the pan.  Add pie weights (dried beans work well, though after you use them once for pie weights, keep them as your pie weight beans and don't try to cook with them.)  Bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool.\n\nLemon Curd\n\n7 Melt butter and creme fraiche together over a double boiler, stirring to combine. (If you don't have a double boiler, bring a couple inches of water to simmer in a saucepan, place a stainless steel bowl on top of the saucepan, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the simmering water.)  Remove top pan from heat and set aside.\n\n8 In a bowl over a double boiler, whisk the eggs and egg yolks just long enough to warm them.  Remove from heat and beat in the butter mixture, then the lemon juice.  Strain the mixture through a sieve into a clean bowl and place over the simmering water.  Add the sugar and zest and whisk until warm to touch, about 4 minutes.\n\nAssemble the Tart\n\n9 Pour the lemon curd into the crust and bake at 350°F for 25 minutes or until set in the middle.  Let cool on a rack.  Chill in the refrigerator.  When ready to serve, top the tart with candied lemon zest.  Garnish with fresh mint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father and I have been experimenting with lemon tart recipes for a year, without much success, by the way (until now). First there was the disastrous lemon tart from the New York Times, described so well by Deb of Smitten Kitchen; we had a similar inedible result. Then there were my several attempts to make a Meyer lemon confit over pastry dough crust, still way too tart. We finally chanced upon a Charlie Palmer recipe with a fabulous lemon curd filling, but his cornmeal crust tasted like baked polenta. Just didn’t work with the lemon curd. So, we took the fabulous filling and put it in a tried and true shortbread-ish crust. Dad even made a batch of candied citrus peel (you can easily skip this step) days in advance. And voilá, a truly delectable lemon tart.\n
948	Pork Mango Picadillo	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large skillet on medium high.  Add small chunks of ground pork to the pan, not stirring, so that the meat has a chance to brown.  Once one side is nicely browned, use a spatula to flip the pieces to the other side, again stirring as little as possible.  Once you have some nice browning, you can stir and cook the pork all pieces are cooked through and no longer pink.  Drain off any fat in excess of a tablespoon.\n\n2 Lower the heat to medium.  Stir in the onions, garlic, cinamon, coriander, cumin, oregano, and thyme. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Gently stir in salsa and mango pieces. \n\n3 Lower the heat to low. Cover and heat through, about 2 minutes. Spoon into serving dish. Sprinkle with chopped almonds and cilantro. \n\nServe with hot cooked rice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Picadillo is a spicy Latin American meat dish often served as a stuffing in chilies, taco filling, or served with rice. I nabbed this recipe from my friend Heidi H’s recipe collection one day because it looked intriguing. What a keeper! Lots of flavor and in the time it takes you to cook the rice, the dish will be done. \n
937	Chicken with Mushroom Cream Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put a cup of flour, a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper in a brown paper bag.  Piece by piece, put a piece of chicken in the bag and shake to coat the chicken with flour mixture.\n\n\n\n2 Preheat the oven to 350°F.  On the stovetop, in a large frying pan, heat oil to medium high heat.  Place the chicken pieces in the pan.  Watch the oil carefully, you don't want the oil to be so hot as to burn the chicken, you just want to lightly brown it.  Brown the chicken pieces on all sides, turning when necessary.\n\n3 Butter a roasting pan generously.  Arrange the chicken pieces in it, pour broth over it, and bake at 350°F until the chicken is tender and cooked, about 40-50 minutes for pieces from a 5-pound chicken.  You know that the chicken is done by poking a thigh with a meat fork (the thigh meat is dark meat and takes longer to cook than white breast meat).  If pink or red juice runs out of the hole made by the fork, the chicken is not done.  If only clear juice runs out, the chicken is done.\n\n\n\n4 About 20 minutes before the chicken is expected to be done, start cooking the onions and mushrooms.  In the same frying pan as was used to cook the chicken, empty the pan of all but 2 Tbsp of oil.  Add the onions to the pan and sauté on medium  heat until softened.  Add the crushed garlic clove and the mushrooms and cook until mushrooms are no longer crisp.  Remove and discard the garlic, and add the sour cream and the heavy cream to the onions and mushrooms.  Lower the heat.  Keep warm, but do not boil.  Salt and pepper to taste.\n\n5 When the chicken is done, remove from oven.  Serve on a platter with the mushroom sauce spooned over it, or served on the side.\n\nServe with noodles, rice, or Spanish rice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“Your website readers are going to love this,” my father exclaimed when he finally finished his plate of chicken smothered in creamy mushroom sauce. Mom found the recipe from one of her favorite cookbooks* now long out of print. The note in the cookbook regarding this recipe is “Brides might well add this to their kitchen repertoire. It is easy to fix and never fails to make a hit.” We all agree. Our six thumbs up on this one.\n
938	Rice Pudding	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk, rice and salt to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until the rice is tender, about 20-25 minutes.  Stir frequently to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  \n\n2 In a small mixing bowl, whisk together egg and brown sugar until well mixed.  Add a half cup of the hot  rice mixture to the egg mixture, a tablespoon at a time, vigorously whisking to incorporate.  \n\n\n\n3 Add egg mixture back into the saucepan of rice and milk and stir, on low heat, for 5 to 10 minutes, until thickened, or about 160°F (71°C).  Be careful not to have the mixture come to a boil at this point or it will curdle.  Stir in the vanilla.  Remove from heat and stir in the raisins and cinnamon.\n\nServe warm or cold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	“Rice pudding is how God intended us to eat rice,” my father announced when I mentioned I was thinking about making some. Well that settled it, rice pudding it would be. With a little investigation, I found that there are two basic ways to make rice pudding – baking or boiling. Then there is my dad’s way, which is take some cold white rice, add some cream, sugar, and cinnamon. Mix and eat. Dad has been making rice pudding this way my whole life, but dad’s method has never appealed to me that much, so boiling or baking it would have to be. The first recipe I tried called for 3/4 cup of heavy cream for a recipe that only served 2 people. Yikes! Too rich, couldn’t eat it. (Ever notice that recipes 20 years and older can be a bit heavy on the cream and butter?) A couple of adjustments later, I settled on this recipe, using the boiling method. It is especially tasty with raisins.\n
939	Chorizo and Eggs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large skillet on medium high heat. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil or bacon fat in the pan. Add the chopped onions (optional) and cook until softened. Once softened, move to the side of the pan and add break up bits of chorizo into the pan. Use a wooden spatula to break up the pieces of sausage. Add the raisins. Stir until the sausage is cooked through, though not necessarily browned. If you are not using lean chorizo, drain the excess fat from the pan before proceeding. If you are not using lean chorizo, you may want to cook the chorizo first, draining the excess fat, then remove to a plate while you cook the onions in the remaining fat. We usually cook with lean chorizo, so excess fat isn't an issue.\n\n2 Crack the eggs one at a time, into the pan. Break the yolks and stir the eggs into the sausage. Add a light sprinkling of salt. Stir constantly until the eggs begin to set, but are still moist. Remove from heat.\nServe immediately with a side of warmed corn tortillas and cilantro as a garnish.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Growing up, we had some of the standard American foods for breakfast – cream o’ wheat, oatmeal, waffles, fried eggs, pancakes (no sugar coated cereals in this household!) – and a couple things I never saw in any of my friends’ homes – huevos, and my favorite chorizo with eggs. My mother is hispanic by ancestry and looks, and even though she doesn’t speak a drop of Spanish she still cooks what she was taught by her mother, grandmother and relatives, growing up in Tucson, Arizona. Thus we alone on our block had chorizo, or Mexican sausage scrambled up with eggs. I didn’t even know that chorizo was the name of the sausage and not the dish until I was in my twenties. What is chorizo? A spicy pork sausage. While the Spanish version is usually spiced with paprika and garlic, Mexican chorizo is spiced with chile peppers. I’ve seen chorizo served in Mexican restaurants most often as a side sausage, like bacon. We cook ours up with the eggs and add some raisins as well, the sweetness of which provides some balance to the spicy chile in the chorizo.\n
940	Curried Potato and Vegetable Soup	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a large pot (6-quart), melt butter over medium high heat.  Add the onion, bell pepper, carrot and cumin seeds.  Cook, stirring occasionally until the onions are soft and the bell pepper is lightly browned. Add the turmeric, mustard seed, and curry powder and cook for a minute more.  Add garlic and cook 30 seconds more.\n\n2 Add the potatoes, the broth, water, cauliflower, and salt.  Increase the heat to high to bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high or medium, enough to maintain a simmer. Let simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.\n\n3 Add the corn and summer squash, cook for 10 minutes more, until the vegetables are cooked through.  Use an immersion blender (or a regular blender) to purée about half of the soup.  Adjust seasonings.\n\nGarnish with chopped cilantro (or parsley, though cilantro is particularly good with this soup).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	In honor of my friend Barbara Harris and her efforts with the food blogger Taste of Yellow event raising awareness for Lance Armstrong’s LiveSTRONG Day, I set out to make a vibrant, yellow soup. This curried potato soup is filled with Yukon Gold yellow potatoes, cauliflower, yellow bell peppers, yellow onions, corn, and yellow summer squash. Can one possibly get more yellow than that? Wait, the butter is yellow too, and turmeric stains everything it touches yellow. This recipe uses a couple summer seasonal ingredients – the corn and squash – but you could easily substitute a sweet potato (put it in early with the Yukon Golds).\nMy mother and I both loved it, especially with some cilantro mixed in. My father doesn’t like curry so his vote doesn’t count.\n
942	Blue Cheese Burgers	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Put ground beef, mustard, garlic, onions, blue cheese, water, egg, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper into a large bowl. Use your hands to gently mix the ingredients together until just incorporated. Do not over-mix. Shape into patties, about 1/2 inch thick and larger than your bun. Chill until you are ready to cook.\n\n2 Prepare charcoal or gas grill for cooking over high direct heat. Using tongs and a folded up paper towel dipped in vegetable oil, oil the grill grates. Make sure grill is hot and well oiled before laying down the patties. Season patties with salt and pepper. Place the patties on the clean, well-oiled grill grate. Grill the burgers for about 5 minutes per side. Do not press down on the burgers while cooking.\nIf you don't have a grill, you can use a grill pan or a cast iron frying pan for the burgers.\nServe on hamburger buns with lettuce and mayonnaise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever made a cheese-stuffed burger? The most common method is to put a mound of cheese between two ultra-thin hamburger patties and pinch the sides. The downside to this approach is that if you haven’t sufficiently sealed the edges of the burgers, all the melted cheese leaks out when you cook them. Also you can scald your tongue on the hot melty cheese if you’re not careful. So, when my pal Garrett described a way for making blue cheese burgers that mixed the cheese in with the burgers, I was all ears. The recipe comes from Garrett’s friend Rob Dodge (thanks Rob!). Garrett calls the burgers “Sassy” and sassy they are indeed. They aren’t as pretty as a stuffed cheese burger, but you’ll get a great dose of tangy blue cheese flavor with every bite. Garrett made these for my parents the other day and they loved them.\n
943	Rhubarb Ginger Galette	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a bowl combine the rhubarb, sugar, flour, orange zest, flour, vanilla, and ginger and allow to macerate for 15 minutes.\n2 Preheat the oven to 375°F. If you are using homemade chilled pie dough, remove it from the refrigerator to let stand for 10 minutes before rolling out.\n3 Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the pie dough to a 13-inch round of even thickness.\n4 Place rolled-out pie dough in the center of a small-rimmed, lightly buttered baking sheet. Use a slotted spoon to lift up the rhubarb mixture, leaving the excess liquid behind, and place the rhubarb mixture in the center of the pie dough round, leaving a border of 2 inches on all sides. Dot the mound of rhubarb with butter. Fold the edges of the pie crust up and over so that circle of the filling is visible.\n5 Bake in the middle rack of the oven. Bake at 375°F for 35-40 minutes. The crust should be slightly browned and the filling slightly bubbly. Cool on a rack for at least half an hour. Serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Garrett McCord who ushers us in to Spring with this rustic rhubarb tart. ~Elise\nEarly Spring is a time of wanting. Where we pace back and forth, twiddling our thumbs, rolling our eyes, waiting for produce to come back and invigorate the stalls at the Farmer’s Market. Sadly though, in March and April, the fruits are lacking or absent. The bulk of the citrus, it’s bright and cheery flavors, now past its season, and the lip staining berries and peaches with juice dribbling down the corners of your mouth are still a bit far off. It is a time that all at home bakers suffer; the annual wait for colorful and vibrant fruit.\nStill, all hope is not lost. Rhubarb, with its sleek ruby red stalks, beckons the curious voyeur to come and gaze upon its slender form. Tempting each onlooker to experiment with it, knowing they’ve all heard the rumors about the delicious taste of rhubarb. While not a fruit, rhubarb is a welcomed relief for the sullen early Spring baker.\n\nIf you’ve never had rhubarb, now is the time to do so. Rhubarb’s flavor is tart and acidic, with a flavorful zing reminiscent of childhood candies. However, when cooked down, the sugars are released and it becomes much sweeter, the flavor becoming deep and resonant.\nWhile in America we traditionally prefer our rhubarb with strawberries this simple galette pairs rhubarb with its classic European companion, ginger. Accented with orange zest and vanilla, it’s a delicious way to break up that little lull in the seasons.\n
944	Crispy Hash Browns	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 3 Tbsp of oil in a large frying pan on medium high heat.\n\n\n\n2 While the pan is heating, squeeze out as much moisture as you can from the grated potatoes.  It's easiest to do this with a potato ricer, using it much like you would a garlic press, except you don't force the potatoes through the ricer.  You just press out the moisture.  If you don't have a ricer, use paper towels to squeeze out as much moisture as you can from the grated potatoes.\n\n\n\n3 When the oil in the pan heats up to the point of shimmering, but not smoking, add the grated potatoes, spreading them out along the bottom of the pan.  The potatoes should not be too thick in any one place, no more than a half inch thick.  Sprinkle some salt and pepper on the potatoes.  After a few minutes, lift up one edge of the potatoes and see how done they are.  If they have fried to a golden brown they are ready to flip.  Use a large spatula to flip the potatoes over all at once, or divide the large potato cake into halves or quarters and flip.  Continue to cook until they are golden brown on the bottom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	The debate usually begins like this.\nME: Dad, how do you make your hash browns turn out so crispy?\nDAD: Use a potato ricer. It’s the only thing I’ve found that really gets the moisture out of the potatoes. The trick to these hash browns is to get rid of as much moisture as possible before cooking them.\nMOM: I always used paper towels to press out the moisture.\nDAD: Your hash browns are mushy.\nMOM: I made this family hash browns for forty years and you never complained. They’re perfectly fine.\nDAD: They were mushy.\nMOM: You ate them!\nDAD: Yes I did. And they were mushy.\n(and the debate continues as I quietly leave the room.)\nMom’s hash browns are mushy. Tasty, edible, yummy, but still mushy. They aren’t as good as dad’s, and that is just a fact. Here’s how dad makes his hash browns.\n
945	Palmiers (Elephant Ears)	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of sugar over your workstation. Roll out the puff pastry to about 10X12 inches. Sprinkle another 1/4 cup of sugar (and spices if using) over the dough.\n\n2 Roll up the left vertical side inward, stopping in the middle of the dough. Roll up the right side of the dough. The two rolls should be meeting at the middle and touching. Press the two sides together gently and let the dough chill in the fridge for at least half an hour. Repeat with any more puff pastry you may have. \n\n3 Starting at one end, cut off pieces of the log, in slices about 1/2 inch in thickness. Lightly sprinkle sugar onto each side. Pinch and press the sides of the two rolls together to ensure that they don't unroll during baking. Place on large parchment lined baking sheets, or a baking sheet lined with a Silpat. They will increase size dramatically, so leave plenty of room between each cookie and only bake a dozen at a time. \n\n4 Set the tray in the middle of the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the sugar has caramelized. Allow them to cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Serve and enjoy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord who shares his dead-easy palmiers cookie recipe with us. ~Elise\nSometimes I just want a quick cookie. Something simple, yet flashy, with very little work on my part. A quick rendezvous in the kitchen with near instant cookie gratification. \nThe answer to this cookie conundrum is the palmier, or elephant ear cookie. A simple French classic, and even though it’s French don’t let that scare you. Puff pastry and sugar. Bake. Done. Class dismissed. \nThis cookie, due to its simplicity, pairs well with many other desserts or after dinner espresso, coffee, and tea. Yet at the same time the simple addition of spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom or vanilla sugar can make this a very fragrant way to end a meal. The palmier can also be reworked into a great savory appetizer if you want; instead of using sugar and spices, replace the sugar with grated Parmesan and roll into it a very thin layer of pesto.\n
946	Spaghetti and Meatballs	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Prepare the sauce.  Heat olive oil in 4-5 quart pot on medium-high heat. Add onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add carrots  and mushrooms, blend together for 2 minutes. Add canned tomatoes, stir together. Add basil and parsley, stir tomatoes with a potato masher until sauce starts to thicken about 5 minutes over medium high heat. Add tomato  paste concentrate, stir to blend. Reduce heat and simmer while preparing meat balls, stirring occasionally. \n\n2 Prepare the meatballs.  Mix by hand in a large bowl beef, Italian sausage, basil, parsley, mushrooms, eggs, breadcrumbs, cheese, herbed  salt, and  pepper until well mixed. Use small melon baller, or teaspoons to form 1-inch round meat balls. Roll and  compress into tight balls. \n\n3 Heat frying pan on high heat. Add olive oil. Sear and brown meat balls on all sides. About 2-3 minutes. Depending on pan size you may need to brown two batches of the meatballs. Do not crowd the pan by stacking the meatballs. Cook in a single layer. Do not over-cook. As meatballs are finishing, add a little bit of red wine to de-glaze pan. \n\n4 Add ¼ cup red wine to the sauce. Then stir in ¼ cup cheese. Add salt to taste. Add meatballs, gently stir. Simmer sauce and meatballs for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. \n\n5 While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot with 4 quarts of water in it to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add 1 Tbsp of salt. When the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. Leave the pot uncovered while you cook the pasta on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put a timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package directions say is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm). Drain.\n\nTo serve, place thin layer of sauce on plate, add pasta, add sauce and meatballs, sprinkle with grated parmesan-romano cheese. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Spaghetti and meatballs, what’s there not to love? Spaghetti and meatballs has to be one of the most fun dishes ever invented, at least from a kid’s perspective. Mounds of spaghetti, fork twirling strands in a spoon, tasty meatballs, even the very serving of the spaghetti, trying to lift just the right amount from the bowl, these are some of my favorite memories from childhood. No, it is not an authentic Italian dish, but an American adaptation. Who cares? Certainly not I. This particular spaghetti and meatballs recipe was given to us by Rick Mindermann, of our local Italian grocery store Corti Brothers. Rick is one of these walking encyclopedias of food knowledge, whose enthusiasm for all things food and cooking is infectious. \n \nFor the following recipe, we adapted it slightly from Rick’s original, added salt to the sauce, cooked the onions before adding the garlic, but it is essentially the same recipe. We love it. My father even declared the other day that from here on out, this is how we are making meatballs.\n
949	Strawberry Rhubarb Terrine	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Bring 2 cups of water, the orange zest, and the sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add the lemon juice and rhubarb pieces.  Bring to a simmer.  Let cook for about 4 minutes, until rhubarb is just tender, but not disintegrating.  Remove the pan from the heat.\n\n2 While the rhubarb is simmering, put 1 cup of cold water in a small bowl.  Pour the gelatin from the packets over the water.  Stir to make sure all of the gelatin powder is wet.  Let soften for about a minute.\n\n3 Put the gelatin water into the rhubarb sugar mixture.  Slowly stir so as not to break up the rhubarb, but to make sure the softened gelatin is completely dissolved.\n\n4 Pour mixture into two loaf pans, evenly divided, or one large casserole dish.  Add the strawberries to the pans, gently distributing them among the rhubarb pieces.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 6 hours, or overnight, until firm.\n\n5 To unmold, fill a large bowl or basin with very warm water.  Dip the bottom of one of the loaf pans into the water and count ten seconds.  Remove from the water and run a blunt knife along the edges of the pan to break the suction.  Place a serving platter upside down over the pan and gently turn the pan over.  You might need to give it a little tap to release the terrine from the mold.  If it's stubborn, place it back in the warm water for a few more seconds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Strawberry and rhubarb has to be one of the world’s best pairings. We love the way tart rhubarb (ever try to eat raw rhubarb?) dances with sweet strawberries in cobblers and pies. In this terrine, orange zest makes an appearance as well. I made this on a whim a week ago to help escape from the heat; an encore performance was demanded a few days later. Each recipe makes two terrines. That’s four terrines for 3 people in 4 days. It’s so pretty too. :-)\n
950	Mom’s Chili Beans	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Start with the pinto beans. (If using canned beans, rinse them and skip to step 2.) Put the beans into a large pot and cover with at least 3 inches of water (about 3 quarts of water).  Bring to a boil and lower the heat to a simmer.  Simmer, covered, for about 2 1/2 hours or until the beans are tender.  \n\nBy the way, my mother uses a pressure cooker to cook pinto beans.  To cook beans with a pressure cooker, cook no more than 2 cups of beans in a 4 quart pressure cooker, with the water added until it reaches the fill line indicated for the capacity of the pressure cooker. Cook the beans for  35 minutes with 15 pounds of pressure and low heat. After 35 minutes, allow the pressure cooker to cool completely. Make sure that the pressure cooker has completely cooled before opening, and if there is any resistance when opening, do not open it. Follow the directions for your particular brand of pressure cooker.  (See safety tips on pressure cookers.)\n\n2 While the beans are cooking cook the rice according to the instructions on the rice package. Add a Tbsp of butter to the rice while it is cooking for flavor.\n\n3 In a large skillet, sauté onions and garlic in 2 Tbsp of olive oil until translucent on medium high heat. Move the onions over to one side of the pan, turn up the heat to high, and brown the meat away from the onions in the same pan. (If you do not have a large enough skillet, use two separate smaller skillets for the onions and beef.) Add chili powder to meat as it is cooking. Start with one tablespoon, and add more as needed to taste. Stir in the onions and garlic. Add chopped parsley. Add one can of tomatoes. Add sliced Jalapeno pepper. Add 1 teaspoon of salt. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes. \n\n4 Once the beans are cooked, drain them.  Add the beans to the meat and onions, adding another teaspoon of salt to the beans as they go in. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, tasting and adding more salt if needed to taste. Stir in cilantro leaves right before serving, or sprinkle on top.\n\nServe over rice or with warm corn tortillas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A staple in our home growing up was my mother’s chili beans, which she still makes several times a month with either ground beef or turkey. Many chilis I’ve encountered seem almost designed to give you heartburn. This one isn’t. These chili beans are more mild and less fatty than most, especially if you use ground turkey. Yet they are very flavorful, hearty, and filling. My mom learned this method of preparing chili beans years ago, when she was still teaching school, from a fellow teacher from Louisiana.\n
951	Kahlúa Brownies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Lightly grease a 9x13 pan. Preheat the oven to 350 F.\n2 In a double boiler or using a bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate and butter together.\n3 With an electric mixer, beat together the eggs, sugar and salt. Add the chocolate mixture and the vanilla extract and Kahlúa. Mix until smooth.\n4 Slowly sift in the flour.\n5 Bake for 45-55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Place on a wire rack to cool for thirty minutes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord and pour yourself a glass of milk; you’ll need one with these brownies! ~Elise\nSo I had a bottle of Kahlúa sitting about collecting dust and figured that it needed to be put to decent use. Now, I’m all for a decent cocktail, but really, I try not to make a habit of breaking out the shaker in the middle of the day.\nThat being said, one must be creative and incorporate neglected liquor in other ways. Now I prefer my coffee with enough chocolate to kill a racehorse, so is it any surprise that I poured a small amount into a batch of brownies?\nI think not.\nThis brownie is rich and fudgy with plenty of chocolate, butter, and six (!) eggs. The addition of coffee liquor just gives it a nice bit of bitter flavor and really makes this the dessert at any party. If you don’t have Kahlúa then using strong coffee or espresso is a perfect alternative.\n
952	Salmon Teriyaki Skewers with Pineapple	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a medium bowl, mix together the soy sauce, mirin or rice vinegar, and brown sugar, until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the fresh ginger, minced green onions, chili pepper flakes, and vegetable oil.  Place the cubes of salmon in the bowl, coat completely with the marinade.  Cover and chill for 1 to 2 hours.\n\n2 Remove salmon from marinade.  Place marinade in a small sauce pan and bring to a boil, simmer for 10 minutes, set aside.\n\n3 Thread salmon, pineapple, and onion pieces on skewers.  If using a grill, prepare grill for high, direct heat. Oil the grill grates.  Place skewers on grill. Cover.   If using an oven broiler, place on a rack on a broiling pan, so that the salmon pieces are 6 inches from the element.  Turn after 2 to 4 minutes.  Baste with reserved marinade.  Cook for 2 to 4 minutes more, basting frequently, until salmon is just barely cooked through.  \n\nServe immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Now that grilling season is officially upon us, I’ve been experimenting with teriyaki salmon skewers. Last night’s version (frozen salmon, canned pineapple) got two thumbs up from the rents, but there were too many leftovers for me to be convinced. Conditioned for politeness, sometimes they are just not willing to be as critical as I’d like. (You can’t like everything mom!) Tried again tonight, this time with fresh pineapple and very fresh salmon and as expected the salmon skewers were a thousand times better (mom agreed). The trick to great salmon skewers is high heat (charcoal grill better than gas better than broiler), the freshest salmon available, and watching the grill (or broiler) like a hawk. Fish can go from perfect to overcooked in a minute.\n
953	Honey Mint Glazed Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place chicken pieces in a bowl.  Mix vinegar with olive oil and pour over chicken pieces.  Turn chicken pieces so that all are coated with the simple marinade.  Let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n2 In a small bowl mix honey, mint, and just enough water for a good basting consistency.  Set aside for glazing the chicken.\n\n3 Prepare grill for medium high heat.  Remove chicken pieces from marinade.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Place chicken pieces on the hot grill, skin side up.  Cook for approximately 30-40 minutes, covered, turning every 7 or 8 minutes.  For the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, baste all sides with the honey mint mixture. The chicken is done when the juices run clear (not pink) when a knife tip is inserted into both the chicken breast and thigh, about 165°F for the breast and 180°F for the thigh.  Note that although the breast pieces are bigger, they may finish cooking earlier than the thighs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Can you tell we are gearing up for grilling season? This has to be one of the simplest chicken recipes for the taste, grilled or otherwise. It’s just basic grilled (or oven broiled) chicken with a fresh mint and honey glaze. Nothing to it really, but it tastes fabulous. This recipe is set up for whole chicken parts, but you could easily use boneless, skinless breasts or thighs; just reduce the cooking time. \n \nWhen we grill meat, we like to marinate the meat first in an acidic marinade. Even half an hour of an acid-based marinade (vinegar or lemon juice) help mitigate carcinogenic effects of grilling. The simple marinade in this recipe will do the trick, will not interfere with the honey mint taste, and will help keep the chicken pieces from sticking to the grill.\n
954	Strawberry Frozen Yogurt	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place the strawberries, lemon juice, salt, and sugar in a medium saucepan.  Heat on medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has completely dissolved.  Use a potato masher to mash up the strawberries as the mixture is heating.  As soon as all of the sugar has completely dissolved, remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes.\n\n2 Stir in the milk and yogurt, until completely incorporated.  Place the mixture in the refrigerator, and chill for at least an hour, preferably several hours, until completely cold, before proceeding.\n\n3 Process the mixture in your ice cream maker (Amazon sells a good one) 20 to 25 minutes. Eat immediately or keep in freezer until served.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When fresh strawberries come into season, and we can get flats of them for only a few dollars, that’s when we start looking for everything and anything to do with them. This strawberry frozen yogurt is a terrific way to take advantage of the abundance of the season. And as the days heat up, it’s a good way to cool down quickly. Although it feels like you’re eating ice cream, this strawberry frozen yogurt is actually much lighter than a typical custard and cream-based ice cream, and it’s filled with the flavor of the fresh strawberries.\n
955	Moroccan Spiced Grilled Chicken Breasts	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Mix the marinade ingredients (yogurt, cilantro, olive oil, garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper) together in a medium sized bowl.  Add the chicken pieces to the bowl and thoroughly coat with the marinade.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator from 6 to 10 hours.\n\n2 Heat your grill on high heat if you are using a gas grill, or prepare coals for direct heat if you are using charcoal. If you do not have a grill you can use a cast-iron grill pan on your stove. Grill the chicken breasts a few minutes on each side, until cooked through.  Take care not to overcook, as chicken breasts can easily dry out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	What I love about this recipe (adapted from one found in the Sacramento Bee) is that with just the barest of preparation, you can have a tasty meal within minutes. The yogurt-based marinade is only mildly acidic, so you can leave the chicken in the marinade all day, while it gently tenderizes the meat and infuses it with the spiciness of cumin and paprika. Just put the chicken in the marinade before leaving for work in the morning, come home, heat the grill, chicken is done in less than 10 minutes. Simple. Easy.\n
956	Franks and Sauerkraut Paprikash	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large thick-bottomed pan or Dutch oven on medium heat.  Melt the butter, add the onion, garlic, and paprika, cook until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes.\n\n2 Add the franks, dill, caraway, and broth.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.\n\n3 Add the sauerkraut, simmer, covered, 15 minutes longer.\n\n4 Remove from heat, stir in the sour cream (do not let the mixture boil after you've added the sour cream).\n\nServe plain, or with boiled or mashed potatoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When my father told me he had made “weenies and sauerkraut”, all I could think of was, not another pork and sauerkraut recipe. My dad must have sauerkraut juice running through his veins by this time, given how often he eats it. But this recipe, adapted from a 25-year old McCalls recipe, really is worth reporting. It’s sort of a paprikash version (sour cream and paprika) of hot dogs with sauerkraut. It’s easy to make, cooks up in little more than half an hour, and wonderfully flavorful. Use your favorite hot dog, frankfurter, mild German sausage, or even tofu-dog if that’s your preference.\n
957	Fava Bean Dip with Goat Cheese and Garlic	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Remove the outer shell from the fava beans.  The easiest way to do this is to work over a large bowl, bend the fava bean pod near one of the beans, squeeze the bean with your fingers, to have it shoot out into the bowl when the bean snaps.  Keep squeezing, pinching and snapping, until you've de-beaned all the pods.\n\n \n\n2 Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon salt.  Add the shelled beans, simmer for 5 minutes.  Use a slotted spoon to remove beans from the hot water and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking and to shock the beans into maintaining their bright green color.  When the beans have sunk to the bottom of the bowl of ice water, fish them out and remove and discard the outer peel.\n\n3 In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium.  Add the chopped green garlic (or chopped regular garlic cloves) and cook until softened, but not browned, about 3 or 4 minutes.\n\n4 Place shelled and peeled beans in a food processor with softened green garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, and water.  Pulse until smooth.  Stream in a tablespoon or two more of olive oil while puréeing.  \n\n5 Scrape mixture out of food processor into a bowl.  Mix in the goat cheese until well combined.  Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.\n\nServe with sliced cucumbers or jicama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Fresh fava beans require patience. You have to shuck them twice, once to remove the thick shell, and then again, after cooking the beans, to peel the outer skin. Are they worth the effort? You tell me. Fresh favas, or broad beans, are only available for a short time in spring, so it’s not an effort that you have to, or get to, make that often. I kind of like the meditative aspects of plopping out the beans from their pods like mini-green-bean rocket ships. Cooked in salty water, they taste a lot like edamame, and can be just as deliciously addictive. Here is a recipe for a simple fava bean dip with garlic and goat cheese. It’s terrific with jicama, and cucumber slices. The cool crunchiness of the jicama or cucumber works well with the creamy beany-ness (for lack of a better word) of the dip. Many thanks to fellow Sacramento food blogger Hank Shaw for supplying me with bunch of fava beans from his garden.\n
958	Mango Chicken Curry	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Heat oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat.  Add onions and bell pepper cook, stirring occasionally,  until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute.  Add the curry powder and cumin, cook for a few more minutes.  The spices will absorb some of the oil, so if anything begins to stick too much to the bottom of the pan, add a little more oil to the pan.  \n\n\n\n2  Add the vinegar, coconut milk, and one of the two chopped mangoes to the pan.  Increase the heat and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove pan from heat.  Scoop the sauce into a blender.  Purée the sauce, pulsing until smooth.  Return the sauce to the pan.\n\n\n\n3  Add chicken pieces and raisins to the pan.  Return to a low simmer.  Cover the pan and let cook for 8-10 minutes.  Chicken should be just cooked through.  Use a knife to cut open the largest piece to check.\n\n4 Add remaining chopped mango to the pan.  Stir in the cream, if using.  Let cook at a very low temperature for another minute or two, uncovered.  Do not let boil!  Or the cream may curdle.   Adjust seasonings.  If a little too sweet, add a little more vinegar.  If not sweet enough, you can add a dash of sugar.  Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServe over rice.  Garnish with cilantro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Updated and revised Jan 2012.\nThere’s something about the combination of mango and chicken that just works. We eat mango chutney with roast chicken so often that I even started making my own chutney just so we wouldn’t run out. Here is a mango chicken curry I whipped up the other day. I love it, but my father thinks it’s a little on the sweet side, so feel free to reduce the amount of mango the recipe calls for if you want a little less sweet. Or add a little more vinegar. The amounts are approximate, feel free to experiment. \n
959	Molded Rhubarb Rosemary Cucumber Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put half of the chopped rhubarb, lemon juice, lemon zest, rosemary, sugar, salt and 2 cups of water into a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes.  Strain and discard solids.  \n\n2 Return strained liquid to pan.  Add the remaining rhubarb to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, on medium, with minimal stirring.\n\n3  Put 1 cup of chilled water into a small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over the water to soften the gelatin.  Let sit for 1 minute.  Stir the softened gelatin mixture into the rhubarb rosemary mixture.  Let the mixture cool until it is slightly warm, no longer hot, to the touch.\n\n4 Pour rhubarb mixture into a mold (can use a loaf pan).  Stir in the chopped cucumber.  Chill in the refrigerator 4 to 5 hours, until set firm.  The top should feel dry, not sticky.  (If you want the cucumber better distributed through the salad, stir it in only after the salad has chilled a while and begun to set.)\n\n5 To unmold, fill a basin or a large bowl with warm water. Lower the bottom of the mold into the water. Count 10 seconds and remove.  Use a blunt knife to loosen the gelatin from the sides of the mold and break the vacuum.  Place a plate upside down on top of the mold and then carefully turn the mold over, holding on to the plate.  Gently lift off the mold.  If the salad sticks to the mold, place it in the warm water for a few seconds more.\n\nKeep chilled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Jelled salads. So very very retro, except perhaps in Utah, where my friend Kalyn tells me Jell-O is the state fruit. Jelled salads and aspics became popular in America in the early part of the last century when food scientists were finally able to stabilize gelatin sufficiently for predictable results in the kitchen. They really took off mid-century when the pre-flavored, already-sugared Jell-O brand mixes became available. My Minnesota grandmother loved gelatin salads like nobody’s business and used to make them for us all the time when I was growing up. I still love Jell-O, gelatin, all things aspic, mostly because of the memories they evoke. People don’t really make things like this that much anymore.\n \nSo, the genesis of this particular salad? My pal Garrett made a truly terrific batch of this rhubarb rosemary jelly from Gourmet, which is made with gelatin, that I thought would make an excellent jelled salad. The combination of rhubarb and rosemary is refreshing and delightful. My first experiment resulted in a too-sweet rhubarb jelled dessert, but the second attempt, with much less sugar and the addition of cool and crunchy cucumbers worked out great. It’s so pretty and pink! Even preppie with the green hues from the cukes. Mom and team loved it. \n
960	Soba Noodle Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat for 1-2 minutes until the sugar and salt dissolve. Stir in the garlic and jalapeño, and allow to cool. Add the lime juice, lime zest, and sesame oil and mix well. \n\n2 Cook the noodles in salted water, until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and then rinse well under cool water. Transfer the noodles to a large bowl and toss with the dressing.\n\n3 Add the mango, bell pepper, basil and mint. Toss and plate. Serve with chopped peanuts sprinkled over the top and lime wedges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord who prepared this fabulous salad for us the other day. Big, big hit. ~Elise\n“Very tangy and sweet! With just enough crunch from the peanuts.”\n“It’s so colorful and aromatic, you can just smell the mint and garlic!”\nThe compliments Elise and I praised this salad with are plentiful. Really, this is a wonderful spring and summer salad, with Asian inspiration. Soba noodles, if you are not familiar with them, are thin Japanese noodles made with buckwheat flour, and are often served cold. Soba noodles can be found in the Asian aisle of many markets; they have a nice body to them and an earthy, old world taste. In this noodle salad, the mango, mint, and various other flavors contrast and match well with each other, giving the whole salad a good balance. \n
961	Jicama Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Toss together the jicama, bell peppers, red onion, cucumber, orange, and cilantro in a large serving bowl.  Pour lime juice over all.  Sprinkle with a pinch of cayenne and paprika.  Season generously with salt.\n\n2 Let sit a half an hour before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Are you familiar with jicama? This tuber looks like a seriously overgrown radish and is the root of a vine native to Mexico and Central America. The flesh is crunchy, mild, and even faintly sweet, and is often served with a little lime juice and chile powder to accompany Mexican dishes. I first encountered jicama (pronounced HICK-ah-mah) years ago in cafeteria salad bars, and on its own (how they typically serve it in those places), jicama can be a little boring. With some seasoning and lime juice, however, it comes alive, and is wonderfully refreshing, especially along side tacos and refried beans. This recipe comes from my friend Arturo who suggested to me the ingredients. (Thanks Arturo!)\n \nJicama salads are usually prepared with julienned jicama a little thicker than what I have shown here. Cut them this small (result of the mandoline) and the jicama pieces will bend a bit. And the salad will resemble more of a slaw than of chunky pieces of jicama. The good news is cut this way the salad will be easier to eat. Julienne or cube the jicama into pieces you are most comfortable eating.\n
962	Roasted Asparagus	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Rinse clean the asparagus. Break the tough ends off of the asparagus and discard.\n\n2 Lay the asparagus spears out in a single layer in a baking dish or a foil-covered roasting pan. Drizzle olive oil over the spears, roll the asparagus back and forth until they are all covered with a thin layer of olive oil. (Alternatively you can put the asparagus and oil in a plastic bag, and rub the bag so that the oil gets evenly distributed.) Sprinkle with minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Rub over the asparagus so that they are evenly distributed.\n3 Place pan in oven and cook for approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on how thick your asparagus spears are, until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Drizzle with a little fresh lemon juice before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever had roasted asparagus turn out tough and stringy? Here’s a tip from my friend Alanna: use the fat spears, not the skinny ones, for roasting. This is a quick and easy recipe for beautifully roasted, tender asparagus.\n
989	As-You-Like-It Breakfast Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the milk and cheese. Add the bread and carefully stir until all pieces of bread are moistened (don't over mix or the bread may disintegrate). Add additions. Add salt and pepper to taste (if using Italian sausage, you won't need either.) Butter a 13 x 9 inch casserole dish. Pour mix into casserole dish.\n\n2 Bake in oven for 50 minutes to an hour, until the top is browned and the center springs back when touched. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	On vacation, 5 o’clock pm, having too much fun to realize that nothing has been planned for dinner, fridge mostly empty, remembering that uh oh, I’m the one in charge of feeding my friend’s children that night. Oops! Open the refrigerator door, see half a dozen eggs, half a carton of milk, some cheddar cheese, leftover sausage from biscuits and gravy the day before, a little broccoli, a leftover ear of corn (cooked). Open the freezer and see half a loaf of sliced bread. Saved. Whew. The kids will not have boxed Mac-n-cheese for dinner.\nHave you ever made a breakfast casserole? The basic ingredients are eggs, cheese, milk, and bread. It’s the easiest thing in the world to put together. We have a sausage breakfast casserole on the site that is one of my favorites. The great thing about a breakfast casserole is that you can add almost anything you want to the base. Italian sausage is my all time favorite, but bacon or ham will do too. Or make it veggie, with zucchini, broccoli, basil and onions. The first time I served this to the kids they insisted that it had to go on the website. The name they picked was “Open Fridge Breakfast Bake” because basically that’s what I did – opened the fridge, put everything I could find into a casserole dish, and baked it. A few days later we cooked it again (this time Reilly, the 11-year old helped) so we could get some photos. Do you have a favorite breakfast casserole combo? If so, let us know about it in the comments.\n
963	Potato Salad with Apples and Bacon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Combine the potatoes and enough cold water to cover by a couple of inches in a large saucepan.  Add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and cover the pan. Simmer for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork. Drain well.\n\n2 While the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon in a heavy-based skillet over medium heat. Once cooked, remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels.  Reserve the bacon fat in the pan.  Once the bacon is cool, chop it.\n\n3 Cook the onion in the fat in the pan on medium heat, until softened and just starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the onion from the pan to a large bowl, set aside.   Add the chopped apple to the bowl.\n\n4 Add the potatoes and chopped bacon to the onions and apple.  Add the green onions, olive oil, vinegar, mustard, and thyme.  Salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServe either warm, room temperature, or cold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Summer is the season for cookouts and potato salad, isn’t it? Our standard potato salad usually includes pickle juice and hard boiled eggs. Here’s a completely different take on a summer potato salad, seasoned with mustard, bacon, and the taste that makes you smile with surprise when you bite into it, chunks of apple. My friend Heidi H made this potato salad for a group of us this week; it’s based on a recipe she found recently in the Boston Globe. Everyone who ate it loved the apple, bacon, mustard, potato combo.\n
964	Zucchini Bread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Butter two 5 by 9 inch loaf pans. \n\n2 In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Stir in the grated zucchini and then the melted butter. \n\n3 Sprinkle baking soda and salt over the mixture and stir it in. Add the flour, a third at a time, stirring after each incorporation. Sprinkle in the cinnamon and nutmeg over the batter and mix. Fold in the nuts and dried cranberries or raisins if using.\n\n4 Divide the batter equally between the loaf pans. Bake for 55 minutes (check for doneness at 50 minutes) or until a wooden pick inserted in to the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes. Turn out onto wire racks to cool thoroughly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I still remember the first time I encountered zucchini bread as a teenager. I had a hard time getting my mind around the concept. At the time, zucchini was something my mom made me eat, and not anything you would bake into something sweet. Fortunately, the pathway into my naturally resistant-to-new-foods teenage mind had already been cut with carrot cake. Heck, if you could get something that good out of carrots, why not zucchini? After one bite, I was sold forever. Grated zucchini, mixed into the batter, brings moisture and tender texture to what is essentially a spice cake. \n \nHere is a favorite, tried-and-true zucchini bread recipe. It couldn’t be easier; you don’t need a mixer and can make the whole thing in one bowl. It’s basically our zucchini muffin recipe in a bread form. \nUpdate, 9-28-2012: I used to also show a second recipe on this page for a version with crushed pineapple. You can now find that recipe on a different page here: Zucchini Bread with Pineapple.\n
965	Salmon Provencal	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n\n2 Blanch the tomatoes by first scoring the ends with a sharp knife, and then plunging them into a pot of simmering salted water for 15-30 seconds. Then put them into ice water for 1 minute. Drain the tomatoes and peel off and discard the skin. Cut the tomatoes into quarters, remove the core and seeds, and dice the flesh.\n3 In a large bowl combine the tomatoes, tarragon, basil, chives and olive oil. Add salt to taste. In another bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, vinegar, and shallots (the acid in the lemon juice and vinegar will help take the sharp edge off of the shallots).\n\n4 Arrange salmon fillets on an oiled baking sheet without crowding. Drizzle with olive oil and season lightly with salt. Bake until salmon is barely cooked through and lightly browned on the edges, 8-12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon fillets.\n\n5 To serve, mix the shallot mixture with the tomato mixture, and spoon a couple tablespoons around each fillet. Sprinkle the salmon with freshly ground black pepper. Serve immediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here’s a salmon dish made for summer. Fresh tomatoes, fresh chopped herbs, a few shallots, lemon juice, balsamic and olive oil make a perfect sauce to accompany baked salmon fillets.\n
966	Wax Beans with Mint	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 A little bit ahead of time, crush a few mint leaves (reserve some for garnish) with a mortar and pestle. Put the crushed mint leaves into a small jar and add a couple tablespoons of high quality olive oil to cover. Let sit for at least an hour if you can. The longer the mint is in the olive oil, the better the infusion.\n2 Prepare the beans by cutting off and discarding the tips and ends. Snap the beans in half, if necessary, to have pieces about 2 inches in length.\n3 15 minutes before serving bring an inch of water in a saucepan to a boil. Place the beans in a steamer basket in the saucepan. Cover and cook, until tender, about 10-15 minutes. Check for doneness after about 8 minutes or so. If a fork easily goes through them, they're done.\n4 Remove beans from pan and place them into a serving bowl. Use a strainer to drizzle the mint-infused olive oil over the beans. Sprinkle salt over the beans to taste. (Fleur de sel would work really well with this dish.) Chop up a few more mint leaves to add as garnish.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Every weekend during the summer, if we are lucky, there will be a good supply of wax beans at the farmers market. These golden yellow (and sometimes purple) versions of green beans are harvested young, and are sweet and tender. Here is a simple way to prepare them, with the subtle flavor of a mint infusion.\n
967	Baked Stuffed Clams	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Fill a large pot with 1 1/2 to 2 inches of water.  Bring water to a boil.  Add the clams to the boiling water. Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the clams steam for approximately 6-10 minutes, until the shells open.  Remove clams from the pot and let cool enough to handle.  Discard any clams that have not opened (if they haven't opened it means they were dead to begin with and should not be eaten).\n\n2 Remove the clam meat from the clams (not the clam foot which is attached to the shell) and mince finely.  Break apart the clam shells from their hinges.  Rinse. Pick 10-12 of the cleanest, nicest looking clam shells and set aside.\n\n3 Preheat oven to 350°F.  In a sauté pan, melt the butter on medium heat and add the minced onion.  Once the onions have softened (2-3 minutes), add the garlic.  Cook the garlic for 1 minute, then add the parsley, bread crumbs, minced clams, lemon juice, and clam juice.  Stir until the stuffing mixture is completely moistened.  (If too dry, add a bit more butter or clam juice; if too wet, add a bit more bread crumbs.)\n\n \n\n4 Lay clam shells on a baking dish.  Scoop a little stuffing mixture onto each clam shell.  Sprinkle with grated Parmesan.  Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, until Parmesan is lightly browned on top.\n\nVariation:\nCook a few strips of bacon until fat renders but not brown or crispy, chop and mix in with the stuffing.  Use crumbled up Ritz crackers for the breadcrumbs. So good!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	For most California girls, the idea of “digging for clams” isn’t really part of our cultural makeup. But out in Rhode Island, and the beaches south of Cape Cod, digging in the sand for your dinner is apparently a regular summertime activity. My friend Alden (age 8) and her sister Piper (my goddaughter, age 5) took me clam digging this weekend. It wasn’t exactly what I expected. Although we went out in low tide, we still had to get chest deep in the water to find a sandy spot to scrape the bottom of with our toes. We found about 6 empty shells or rocks for every intact clam. We were out for more than an hour, shoulders sunburned and toes scraped, nearly stung by red jelly fish, and managed to get a grand total of 9 clams (3 clams each). I know there are more efficient ways to do this (as I’m sure some of you will tell me), but at the end of the day, it didn’t matter. Hunting for clams was just a great excuse to play in the warm sea water on a beautiful sunny day. \nHere’s the recipe for stuffed clams (also called “stuffies”) that Alden and Piper’s mom Heidi made with our hard-earned catch. Do you have a favorite recipe for stuffed clams? Please let us know about it in the comments. I’ve heard that they are especially good with a little Portuguese sausage mixed in the stuffing.\n
968	Blueberry Peach Fruit Salad with Thyme	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If using water and sugar place them into a saucepot and bring to a boil and liquid is reduced by half into a simple syrup. Allow to cool.\n\n2 Chop up the peaches and nectarines and place them in a bowl with the blueberries. Pour over the cooled simple syrup or agave syrup. Add the thyme, lemon juice, lemon zest, and ginger.\n\n3 Stir and cover with plastic wrap, place in the fridge and allow to macerate for one hour. Serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome Garrett McCord who shares this delicious cancer-fighting fruit salad with us. ~Elise\nRecently my mom, Suzanne McCord, was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was surprised when I heard the news, my mother is in her early sixties, but is insanely active and healthy. The woman recently participated the AIDS lifecycle event; a 6 day, 550 mile bike ride. A few days after, she was off to Egypt and Russia. I get tired biking to work, and my last big trip was Napa which is only an hour away. In fact, her main concern after being diagnosed was that the surgery would get in the way of her bike riding. \nAfter hearing about mom, I went to work doing some research about ways I could help using what I know best – food. I wanted to put together something that was easy to prepare, full of flavor, and packed with cancer fighting vitamins and antioxidants. After a bit of research into cancer smart foods and what seemed to work well, I developed this recipe.\nThis simple fruit salad works at the start of the meal or as a dessert. The fruit is lightly glazed with either a simple syrup or agave syrup. Ginger, a bit of lemon, and some savory thyme which pairs amazingly with summer fruits accents the tartness of the berries and the sweetness of the stone fruit. In recognition of my awesome, kicking cancer-butt mom, I’ve nicknamed this a Suzanne Salad. \n
969	Chicken Pozole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place chicken pieces in a large pot, cover with about 3 quarts of water. Add one onion, sliced in half, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer uncovered until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 20-30 minutes.\n2 Remove chicken from pot, let cool so that it is cool enough to handle. Use a fork to pull chicken meat away from the bones. Set the meat aside and return the bones to the stock pot. Continue to simmer the bones, uncovered, for another half an hour.\n\n3 Take 4 cups of the hominy (about half of the can) and place into a blender. Scoop 2 cups of the chicken stock from the stock pot and add it to the blender. Add 4 peeled cloves of garlic to the blender. Place the lid on the blender, cover with a towel so that you don't get burned, hold down the cover and blend until completely puréed.\n4 Skim foam and excess fat from the top of the surface of the stock. Remove the bones and any solids from the stock pot and discard. Pour in the blended hominy to the pot. Add the remaining whole hominy to the pot. Add 2 Tbsp of crumbled dried oregano. Bring to a simmer and cook for an additional 20 minutes.\n5 While the hominy is cooking in the stock, prepare the garnishes. Arrange on a large platter or in several small bowls. Right before serving, shred or chop the cooked chicken meat and add it back to the pot. Add salt to taste.\nServe pozole in individual bowls topped with the garnishes of your choice. Serve with tostadas (flat fried corn tortillas) or tortilla chips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	I’ve been begging my friend Arturo to teach me how to make pozole for months now. The problem is that it is sort of like asking someone to make you “taco night”. Pozole is a big production, not in the making of it, but in all of the wonderful garnishes you can add to it. Pozole is a traditional soup or stew of Mexico, from pre-Columbian days. The name is derived from the Nahuatl “potzolli” and the stew is made with hominy and pork or chicken. This particular version of Arturo’s is made with chicken, and is called “pozole blanco” in his native state of Guerrero, Mexico, where pozole is practically the state dish. While in New Mexico posole is traditionally served on Christmas eve, in Guerrero it is served every Thursday and Saturday, all year long. Light and healthful, pozole is also a common Mexican cure for a hangover, ironic in that it is also traditionally enjoyed with mezcal.\n
970	Shrimp Ceviche	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of water, salted with 2 Tbsp salt. Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute to 2 minutes max, depending on size of shrimp. (Over-cooking the shrimp will turn it rubbery.) Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and place into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.\n2 Drain the shrimp. Cut each piece of shrimp in half, or into inch-long pieces. Place shrimp in a glass or ceramic bowl. Mix in the lime and lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate for a half hour.\n3 Mix in the chopped red onion and serrano chile. Refrigerate an additional half hour.\n4 Right before serving, add the cilantro, cucumber, and avocado.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	With the warm days of summer upon us, a great way to cool off is with ceviche. Ceviche is typically made with red snapper that is “cooked” by the acidity of lime and lemon juice (see this ceviche recipe.) This version is prepared with shrimp, which is first lightly cooked, and then marinated in the citrus juice. My father, who generally doesn’t really like shrimp that much, loved this ceviche. (Gotta love it when they eat it up and ask for more.)\n\nWhy pre-cook the shrimp? While the acidic marinade “cooks” the proteins, it doesn’t kill the bacteria. Whereas this isn’t as much of an issue with raw fish (think sushi, sashimi), it is with shellfish like shrimp and scallops which can go bad much more easily. Unless you are getting your shrimp straight off the boat, for food safety reasons it’s best to lightly pre-cook the shrimp.\n
971	Ginger Chicken with Almonds	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Slice chicken crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Toss with ground coriander, grated ginger, 2 teaspoons oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Marinate at room temperature 15 minutes.\n2 Thinly slice white parts of scallions. Julienne green parts; set aside.\n3 Stir together chutney, broth, and garlic in a small bowl.\n\n4 Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet (or wok) over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and julienned ginger; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry until thoroughly cooked, 4 to 6 minutes. Add scallion greens and chutney mixture; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Transfer to shallow bowls with hot cooked rice (or without rice, for low-carb version). Sprinkle with toasted almond slices and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Steve-Anna recently sent me this wonderful recipe for ginger chicken and claimed that it was one of her all time favorites. My father doesn’t eat ginger if he can avoid it, so when I made it I just warned dad ahead of time that he might have to settle for yesterday’s leftovers if he couldn’t bring himself to touch it. Well, everyone loved it, even dad. Strips of boneless, skinless chicken breasts are briefly marinated in ground coriander, ground ginger, vinegar and oil, then they are stir-fried with scallions and julienned ginger. They are mixed with a little mango chutney and sprinkled with toasted almonds before serving.\nThe whole dish can be made in half an hour, especially if you do a lot of the prep while the chicken is marinating.\n
972	Plum Sorbet	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Place the sliced plums, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a blender and purée until very smooth. Push the plum puree through a fine mesh sieve to catch and large pieces of skin and discard them.\n\n2 Mix the Grand Marnier to the purée just before churning.  Place the purée in an ice cream machine and churn according to instructions, for approximately 25 minutes. Serve immediately or place in an air tight container and put in the freezer for two hours to firm up. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord who turned a few of our ripe plums into a “wow-that’s-good” sorbet. ~Elise\nI developed this recipe out of necessity rather than noble ingenuity. Every summer Elise’s mother loads me up with so many plums I can’t eat them all in time, and many begin to get a bit over ripe, their skins bursting at the slightest touch sending their juice down my arms and onto my clothes and floor. \nTaking these plums and churning them into a magenta hued sorbet just seemed like the most logical thing to do in this heat. Sweet, tart, and smooth it’s a wonderful way to enjoy fresh plums at the height of their season. This sorbet is just sweetened enough in my opinion, but taste as you go and add more or less sugar accordingly as some of the plums we used were very tart. In addition, this recipe could easily be adapted to overripe apricots or pluots as well. \n
973	Wild Rice Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put the chicken broth in a medium sized saucepan.  Add the rice and wild rice, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover.  Let cook for 40 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool completely.\n\n2 Heat a small skillet on medium high heat.  Add the pine nuts.  Cook, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted.  Remove pine nuts from pan and let cool.\n\n3 Whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.\n\n4 In a large bowl gently mix together the cooled cooked rice, chopped celery, green onions, peas, dried cranberries, pine nuts, and dressing. Add salt and pepper to taste, if needed.\n\nChill completely before serving. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Looking for a great summer picnic salad to take to your next potluck? I recently enjoyed this rice salad while visiting my friend Chigiy who was hosting a summer BBQ. “Enjoyed” is the polite way of saying I ate a lot of it, and pretty much all of the leftovers the next day. The recipe is from Chigiy’s friend Wendy (thank you Wendy!) who has generously passed it on to us. Made it here for my folks, and I still want to eat it all.\nDon’t know about you, but I love rice salads. If you have a favorite one, please let us know about it in the comments.\n
974	Grilled Tomatoes	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Standing over a sink, use your fingers to gently dislodge and remove the watery pulp and seeds. (Although the seeds and pulp contain a lot of flavor, when you grill the tomatoes they are going to be lost anyway.)\n\n \n\n2 Preheat your grill on high heat for direct grilling.  Use a grill basket or fine grill grate if you can, it will make it much easier to work with the tomatoes (or any other vegetables you grill).  Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper.  Brush the cut side of the tomatoes with olive oil.  Brush the grill grate or grill pan with olive oil.  Place the tomatoes, cut side down on the grill surface.  Cover the grill and let cook for about 4 minutes. (Check after 2 minutes.)  Use a metal spatula to lift tomatoes off of the grill for serving.\n\n3 Place on a serving dish, cut side up.  Drizzle a little more olive oil on the tomatoes.  Sprinkle with just a little more salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with thinly sliced basil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Mid July is about the time of year when tomatoes start coming full steam into season. I have 5 tomato plants in my garden that are now producing more tomatoes than we can think up ways of using them. (Gazpacho anyone?) One quick and easy recipe that I played around with this week is to simply grill the tomatoes, cut side down, and season with olive oil, salt, pepper, and sliced basil. When you are working with garden fresh tomatoes, sometimes doing less is more, because the produce is so good to begin with.\nDo you have a garden that is full of tomatoes? What are your ways of using up the bounty? Please let us know in the comments.\n
975	Snickerdoodles	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Preheat your oven to 350°F. Cream the butter until it's soft, smooth and light.\n2 Add both of the sugars to the creamed butter and mix until they are fully incorporated, and lighter in color. Add salt.\n Cream the butter and sugars until fully incorporated and light in color (right).\n3 Stirring vigorously, add the egg to the mixture and beat until the batter looks uniform.\n4 Sift the flour, cornstarch and baking soda, and fold, in three additions, into a large bowl to create cookie dough.\n5 Form balls of dough with a soup spoon and plop them in cinnamon sugar, swirling to coat.\n\n6 On a buttered or parchment lined cookie sheet, place the dough balls 3 inches apart. Flatten the dough slightly and sprinkle about half a tablespoons worth of cinnamon sugar on the flattened surface.\n7 Set the first timer for 7 minutes. Turn the pan around and set a second timer for 7 minutes. If you are using a buttered pan they might be done at this point, or need another minute. If you’re using parchment, cookies will take 2-3 minutes more. You are looking for golden edges and a blonde middle.\n8 Cool on a baking sheet and eat as soon as possible. Snickerdoodles will keep in an airtight container, at room temperature for 3 days, but they are best eaten the day they’re made.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author and pastry chef Shuna Fish Lydon of Eggbeater, who shares with us her secrets for making snickerdoodles. ~Elise\nWhile people argue about where the name Snickerdoodle comes from, few people who love them waste time with words. Here is a cookie with a following! Tender and crisp, plain and aromatic, sweet with a dash of salt, the Snickerdoodle has made quite a place for itself in the canon of cookies. But as loyal as its fans are, it’s not the easiest cookie to find on bakery shelves.\nA Snickerdoodle has two signature characteristics: an exterior of cinnamon sugar, cracked on top, and a perfect textural balance of crunchy and pliable.\nWith other cookies born from the same method– creaming, getting just the right texture can feel like an impossible journey with way too many cookies to eat along the way. Snickerdoodles, on the other hand, have a built-in fail proof ingredient, saving them from the place where cookies that aren’t “just right” go. Cornstarch.\n\nIt’s simple and yet extraordinary: cornstarch absorbs moisture, binds the dough like flour but has no gluten. Gluten is a protein in wheat flour that creates a “toughness” in many baked goods. “Do not overmix” is an instruction based on this property. In Snickerdoodle dough, cornstarch is what makes those edges light as air, but provide a middle you can sink your teeth into.\nThis is not a puffy cookie, it spreads a lot. It’s simple, meaning there are few ingredients. Please use the most delicious butter you can find. Organic cinnamon will also make a huge difference, and if you can get your hands on true Ceylon cinnamon, Snickerdoodles all over the land, and I, salute you.\n
976	Watermelon Salad with Feta or Cotija	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Soak the chopped red onion in the lime juice while you are prepping the other ingredients, about 15 minutes.\n\n2 Gently combine all ingredients into a large serving bowl.\n\nServe immediately.  Salad will get soggy if kept overnight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Call me unadventurous, but I had never even heard of a watermelon feta salad before versions of it started popping up on food blogs everywhere. Even then, the very thought of it gave me pause. Watermelon, with salty cheese? Yeah, right. But watermelon sprinkled with salt is how many people enjoy the fruit, so perhaps it isn’t too far of a stretch to consider that it might be good with salty cheese? Last week my curiosity was finally satisfied when I was served such a salad at a dinner given by my friend Peg. I couldn’t wait to recreate it and experiment as well with a more Southwest version with cilantro and cumin. Both versions are wonderfully refreshing and light, and perfect for heat-wave days like we are having now in California.\n
983	Bread and Butter Pickles	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n1 Carefully rinse the cucumbers, scrubbing away any dirt that may have stuck to the ribs. Slice off 1/8-inch from the ends and discard. Slice the cucumbers in 1/4-inch thick slices, place in a large bowl. Add the sliced onions and pickling salt. Stir in so that the salt is well distributed among the cucumber slices. Cover with a clean tea towel (thin towel, not terry cloth). Cover with a couple of inches of ice. Put in the refrigerator and let chill for 4 hours. Discard ice. Rinse the cucumber and onion slices thoroughly, drain. Rinse and drain again.\n2 If you are planning to store your pickles outside of the refrigerator for any length of time, you will need to sterilize your jars before canning, and heat the filled jars in a hot water bath after canning. If you are planning to eat the pickles right away and store them the whole time in the refrigerator, you can skip the water bath step. It's still a good idea to sterilize the jars first, you can do that by running them through the dishwasher, or placing them in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes. To sterilize the jars for canning, place empty jars on a metal rack in a large, 16-qt canning pot. (Jars must rest on a rack in the pot, not on the bottom of the pot). Fill with warm water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to warm to keep the jars hot and ready for canning. Remove with tongs or jar lifters one by one as you can the cucumbers. Sterilize the lids by bringing a pot of water to a boil and pouring water over a bowl containing the lids.\n3 In a 4 qt or 6 qt pot, place the vinegar, sugar, and all of the spices. Bring to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the sliced cucumbers and onions. Bring to a boil again. As soon as the sugar vinegar solution begins boiling again, use a slotted spoon to start packing the hot jars with the cucumbers. First pack a jar to an inch from the rim with the vegetables. Then pour hot vinegar sugar syrup over the vegetables to a half inch from the rim. Wipe the rim clean with a paper towel. Place a sterilized lid on the jar. Secure with a metal screw band.\n4 If you are planning to store pickles outside of refrigerator, process the filled jars in a hot water bath for at least 15 minutes. Return filled jars to the same canning pot with its already hot water. Water level needs to be at least one inch above the top of the cans. Bring to a boil and let boil hard for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes for altitiudes of 1001 to 6,000 feet. Over 6,000 feet, boil for 25 minutes. Remove jars from pot. Let cool down to room temperature. Jars should make a popping sound as their lids seal. If a lid doesn't properly seal, do not store the jar outside of the refrigerator.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Boxes filled with cucumbers from the farmers market, scores of mason jars, big pots, lots of activity in the kitchen, fresh homemade pickles. These are some of my memories from summers growing up. My grandmother (dad’s mother) and my parents used to pickle a lot when I was a kid. My dad’s favorite was spicy carrot and cauliflower pickles (I’m still waiting for the recipe); my favorite was sweet watermelon rind pickles (can’t find watermelons with thick enough rinds to make these anymore). Sweet pickles like these bread and butter pickles (who came up with that name?) never lasted that long around here; we kids gobbled them up.\nBread and butter pickles are easy to make, and if you are planning to make them as refrigerator pickles (storing them in the cold fridge, to be eaten within weeks), you can skip a lot of the canning steps. This is a basic recipe which we happen to love, cobbled together from various editions of the Joy of Cooking plus some online research. The ice helps keep the cucumbers crispy, as does cooking them just a short time. You can experiment with the pickling spices, and the pickling vegetables for that matter. A friend recently told me about an idea for bread and butter jalapeño pickles that sound too good not to try to make. Do you have a favorite bread and butter pickle recipe? If so, please tell us about it in the comments.\n
977	Rosemary Chicken Skewers with Berry Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Cut the chicken into 1 1/2 inch pieces and place in a bowl. Mix with the wine, oil, rosemary, and pepper. Cover and set aside to marinate in the refrigerator for one hour. \n\n2 Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Thread the chicken onto skewers and season generously with salt. \n\n3a Grilling Preheat the grill for direct high heat. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Place chicken skewers on grill and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Place on a platter and cover with foil to allow the chicken to rest.\n\n3b Broiling Preheat the broiler.  Place skewers on an oiled broiling pan, 5 to 6 inches away from the burner. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Place on a platter and cover with foil to allow the chicken to rest.\n\n4To make the sauce, place the marinade and the berries in a sauce pan and simmer gently until the berries are soft. Press through a strainer and discard the pulp.\n\n5 Return the juice and marinade mixture to the pan. Add the vinegar, jelly, and nutmeg and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered until it has reduced by about 1/3 to a light syrup-like consistency.\n\nPlate the skewers and spoon the sauce over the chicken. Serve immediately. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Garrett McCord, who grilled these chicken skewers with me the other day to rave reviews from the ‘rents. ~Elise\nI’ve always been a fan of combining sweet fruits with savory spices, it sets up a certain flavor balance that just works so well. Mango with chili pepper, peaches and thyme, rhubarb and rosemary. They’re all delicious, so can there be any question that blackberries and rosemary would just be a match made in heaven?\nElise and I found the inspiration for this recipe in a tattered old cookbook; it needed a quite a bit of tweaking but we finally nailed it. The sweet sauce really makes the rosemary pop on these summer time chicken skewers. Believe me, we were sopping up this marinade with bits of watermelon, lettuce, strawberries, anything we could get our hands on. \n
978	Limeade with a Touch of Mint	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a small saucepan bring to a boil the sugar, one cup of water, and the lime zest. Once the sugar is dissolved (which it should be by the time the water boils), remove from heat and let cool for for a few minutes. The amount of sugar is a guideline, it depends on how sweet you like your limeade and how tart your particular limes are.\n2 Place a strainer over a bowl, or wide-mouthed serving container, and pour the sugar syrup through it, straining out the lime zest. Add the lime juice and 2 cups of water. Taste for sour/sweet balance. If too sweet, add a little more lime juice. Add several sprigs of fresh mint.\nChill, or serve immediately over ice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	After one of the best July 4ths on record (70s in Sacramento in July? unbelievable) we’re gearing up for another heat wave. If the smoke clears enough for us to go outside again, I’ll make another batch of this wonderful limeade. There are 3 tricks to this simple drink. The first is to make simple syrup by boiling water with the sugar first, so that the sugar is completely dissolved. The second trick is to infuse the simple syrup with some of the zest from the limes; this makes it taste even limey-er (yes, not a word, but you get my drift). Finally plop some fresh mint sprigs in the serving pitcher, and besides being half-way to a mojito, you have a cheerfully refreshing summer drink. One that my nephew Austin has mentioned 3 times in the last 2 days as being “like really good”.\n
979	Berry Almond Crumble	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large bowl put berries and mix with tapioca, sugar and lemon zest. (Without tapioca, crumble will be very runny.) Set aside.\n\n2 Make the topping by whisking together the flour, sugars, spices and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the melted butter and almonds until coarse crumbs form.\n\n3 Pour the filling into a 9-inch square or round pan (do not grease first). Using your fingers, form topping mixture into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch crumbs and spread over cake. Bake until filling bubbles and topping is light golden, about 45-55 minutes. Let cool at least half an hour. Serve warm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My dessert obsessed father was at it again today; he just couldn’t resist this berry crumble recipe he found in the New York Times. He used fresh strawberries, blueberries, and some of our frozen boysenberries. Our boysenberries tend to be pretty tart, so with the 3 Tbsp of sugar, the crumble ended up rather tart. Perfect for my dad and me, but my mother complained (“why can’t you make it the way I like it? Why do you always have to make things like this so tart?”) Mom knows she’s welcome to bake anything she wants the way she likes it, so this conversation didn’t go very far. But check your berries if and when you make this recipe. Add more or less sugar depending on your preference and how sweet the fruit is. By the way, one thing we’ve noticed lately is that the strawberries we get by Driscoll haven’t been very sweet, and don’t have nearly the flavor of the strawberries we get at the farmer’s market or at the local fruit stand.\nHappy July 4th!\n
980	Bourbon Barbecue Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the butter and oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat.\n2 Grate the onion through the coarse grate of a box grater, or finely mince the onion if you don't have a grater.\n3 Add grated onion and chile to the oil/butter combination and cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes, or until onions turn translucent. You do not want the onions to turn color.\n4 Take the pan off the heat and add the bourbon. Return to the stove, turn up the heat to medium-high again and boil down the bourbon for 5 minutes.\n5 Add the ketchup, lemon juice, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and the sugar. Mix well and return to a simmer.\n6 Cook the sauce for a few minutes to combine the flavors and then taste test it. Is it salty enough? (It should be from the Worcestershire sauce). If not, add salt. Is it spicy hot enough? If not, add a little cayenne powder. Is it sweet enough? If not, add some molasses.\n7 Let the sauce cook down slowly until it thickens, about 20 minutes. Keep it on low heat while your ribs cook. Alternatively, you can make this sauce ahead of time and reheat it when you cook the meat. It will stay good in the fridge at least a week; I've held mine for two weeks with no problem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Hank Shaw who shares the recipe for his favorite BBQ sauce with us. This sauce is, btw, outrageously good. ~Elise\nAll barbecue cooks have their own “secret sauce,” but for the most part, each relies on some sort of sugar, something acidic like vinegar, fat – typically butter – and something else to make it special. This sauce uses molasses, lemon juice, bourbon and Worcestershire sauce as its main flavors. It has that tart, sweet, salty, rich and spicy combination that I think all great barbecue sauces need. Use this with ribs, pulled pork or even tri-tip.\n
981	Plum Upside Down Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter the insides of the ramekins. Melt 3/4 stick (6 Tbsp) of the butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar and whisk until smooth. Pour into the bottoms of the buttered ramekins, dividing the sugar butter sauce evenly among them. Arrange a layer of plum slices at the bottom of each ramekin.\n2 If you are not using buttermilk, combine milk and lemon juice in a small bowl (the mixture will curdle), set aside. In a separate bowl, sift together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.\n3 Use an electric mixer to beat together the remaining 1/2 stick (1/4 cup or 4 Tbsp) butter with the granulated sugar and orange zest. Add the eggs and vanilla, mix to combine. Alternately add the dry flour mixture and the buttermilk (or lemon soured milk) mixture to the batter.\n4 Divide the batter among the ramekins. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and put in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until cakes are firm to the touch, and a toothpick or skewer inserted in the center does not come out with raw batter on it. (Might be wet from plum juice.) Turn the baking sheet around half-way through the baking to ensure an even baking for all the cakes.\n5 Remove from oven and let cool on a rack until no longer hot to the touch. Run a paring knife around the edges of the ramekins. Invert onto a plate and gently lift off of the plate.\nServe alone or with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father should have a t-shirt that reads “I’ve never met a dessert I didn’t like” or in this case, “Got Plums? Will Bake”. His baking endeavors might not always look their bakery best (please don’t ever ask him to frost a cake and sometimes his pies are downright scary-looking) but more often than not the results taste fabulous. This plum upside-down cake is actually quite pretty and is based on a recipe he found in an old issue of Fine Cooking magazine. The taste idea is that of slices of tart plum balanced by a sweet cake base. He used red Santa Rosa plums that are just now coming ripe. My mother thought the cake was just a bit too tart for her, but dad and I love it just the way it is.\nNow that I think about it, the t-shirt should simply say “Real Men Bake”. Because if you could just see my 6’2″, 200 lb, works out 3 times a week at the gym, mows the lawn, splits the wood, 78-year-old father in his striped apron, gently arranging plum slices on top of melted butter and sugar in ramekins, that would be the T that fit the best.\n
985	Shrimp Fried Rice	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a bowl, toss the shrimp with the salt, pepper and cornstarch. Let marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Heat a wok or large sauté pan on high heat. When the pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate, add just 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat pan.2 Add the shrimp, quickly spreading out around the cooking surface area so that they are not overlapping. Let fry, untouched for 30 seconds. Flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the pan onto a plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.3 Turn the heat to medium, let the pan heat up again. Add the eggs, stirring in a quick motion to break up and scramble the eggs. When the eggs are almost cooked through (they should still be slightly runny in the middle), dish out of the pan into the same plate as the cooked shrimp.4 Use paper towels to wipe the same wok or sauté pan clean and return to high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling to coat. When the oil is very hot, add the green onions and fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in the rice and stir well to mix in the green onions throughout. Spread the rice all around the wok surface area and let the rice heat up, untouched until you hear the bottoms of the grains sizzle, about 1-2 minutes. Use the spatula to toss the rice, again spreading the rice out over the surface of wok.5 Drizzle the soy sauce all around the rice and toss. Add the peas and carrots, the cooked eggs, shrimp and sesame oil, tossing to mix the rice evenly with all of the ingredients. Let everything heat back up again, until the rice grains are so hot they practically dance! Taste and add an additional 1 teaspoon of soy sauce if needed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Jaden Hair of Steamy Kitchen who is doing a series of Chinese American food recipes for us here on Simply Recipes. ~Elise\nThe first time I attempted to cook fried rice on my own, I was 15 and my parents and little brother were in Europe on vacation. I stayed home to attend summer school and to enjoy a little freedom living on my own for a couple of weeks.\nSince my Mom was the queen in the kitchen, I didn’t really cook too much back then. My job was just to eat and enjoy her wonderful home cooked meals. But that week, after 3 days of instant ramen, I was longing for something a little more substantial. Too lazy to bike to the market, I decided on fried rice. I steamed a batch of rice and found enough bits of vegetables to make the dish.\nIt was a total disaster. Mushy, soggy and goopy. Back to Top Ramen for another 10 days.\nWhen the family returned, I told Mom about my fried rice misfortune and she laughed, “You better start learning from me before you go off to college or you’ll starve!” And a crash course in fried rice followed the next day.\nSo here I am to teach you what I learned from my Mom. These are her secrets to light, fluffy and flavorful fried rice, no matter what ingredients you use.\n \nUse previously chilled leftover rice\nTo get the perfect fried rice, you’ll want to use yesterday’s rice as it’s had a chance to dry out a bit in the refrigerator. The heat of the pan and the liquid seasoning (soy sauce) will re-steam and hydrate the leftover rice. If you try to use freshly cooked, hot rice (like I did years ago,) you’ll end up with too much moisture in the rice and will make a heavy mess in the pan.\nHigh heat is essential\nBut high heat doesn’t mean that you need super high BTU’s or a gas stove. All it takes is a bit of patience to let your pan or wok heat up. The high heat ensures that whatever ingredients that you put into the pan gets fried quickly and that each grain of rice gets hot to the core.\nDon’t touch\nA common mistake of stir frying is to constantly poke, prod, turn and flip every second. In a restaurant kitchen where flames are so powerful they can singe your brows, chefs have to keep things moving. But in home kitchens, our stovetops need a little more time to do their work to heat up and cook our food. If you keep poking at the rice, the grains will break, release more starch and turn the entire thing goopy. It will never have a chance to fry correctly…not enough “wok time” as my Mom likes to say. The best thing is to do is to spread out the rice, use the entire cooking surface of the pan and just leave it alone. Put your spatula down and back away from the stove for a minute. Give the rice a chance to heat up. Then flip, toss and redistribute the rice, again spreading it out and leaving it alone to cook another side.\nFry ingredients separately\nFried rice has many different ingredients, and in my home it’s usually just a mixture of whatever vegetables, meats or seafood I can scrounge up from the refrigerator or freezer. But whatever the ingredients, you want to make sure that you can taste each individual one. To do this, you’ve got to fry your meat or seafood first, remove from the wok or pan when 80% cooked through and then toss it back in towards the end of the stir fry to finish cooking. Because if you try to fry all of the ingredients at the same time in the same pan, they’ll all compete for “wok time” and everything will end up tasting exactly the same!\n
986	Peach Cobbler	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n1 In a large bowl, mix peaches, 2/3 cup sugar, and the tapioca, lemon peel, lemon juice, and vanilla. Let stand at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes to soften the tapioca, stirring several times.\n \n2 In another bowl, combine flour with remaining 1/3 cup sugar, the baking powder, and nutmeg. With a pastry blender or your fingers, incorporate butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cream and stir just until dough holds together.\n \n3 In a buttered shallow 2 1/2 to 3 quart baking dish, spread fruit level. Using your hands, crumble dough evenly over fruit.\n4 Bake in 350°F oven until fruit mixture bubbles in center and topping is golden brown, 50-60 minutes.\nDelicious with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friends know me well. They know if they invite me over and I see that they have bushels of fresh-picked peaches just waiting for a home that I will offer my own kitchen counter space to take some of those gorgeous peaches off their hands. Such sacrifice, yes, I know. ;-)\nPeaches, nectarines, and all manner of stone fruit are glorious in summer. Here is a simple and delicious peach cobbler recipe that we’ve used for several years. Feel free to experiment with the ratios and the fruit. You can easily add in some blueberries or nectarines. If your peaches aren’t perfectly sweet to begin with, you may need to add more sugar to the filling.\n
987	Grits with Corn and Onion Greens	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat the oil n a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the grated onion and cook, stirring, until transparent, about 2 minutes. Add the corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kernels become soft, about 5 minutes.\n\n2 Add the milk, water, and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Whisk in the grits, decrease the heat to low, and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the grits are creamy and thick, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir in the butter, Parmesan, parsley, and chopped green onions. Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A dear friend of mine from Alabama called me recently and demanded to know, “why aren’t there any grits on your site?!” Uh, because I’m not Southern and I don’t know what the heck I’m talking about when it comes to grits and I can’t even try to fake it with our readers? Well, not knowing what we are doing has never stopped us in the past, and my dear ole dad found a recipe for grits he couldn’t pass up. This was so good I made him make it twice. What I have learned in researching grits is that people who grew up eating them are passionate about how they like them – white corn, hominy grits, with syrup for breakfast, etc. So, if you have a particular way that you like your grits, please let us know about it in the comments. \nBy the way, according to NBC, Michael Phelps eats grits for breakfast, along with several fried egg sandwiches, an omelet, three slices of French toast, and a stack of chocolate chip pancakes. Breakfast of champions.\n
992	Quick Beef Stir-Fry with Bell Peppers	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n1 Season the steaks with salt and pepper and rub minced garlic over one side.  Place the steaks between two sheets of plastic wrap.  With a meat pounder, pound the steaks to a 1/4 inch thickness.  Let the steaks sit for 10 minutes to absorb the flavor of the garlic.  Then cut them across the grain in 1/2-inch wide strips.\n\n2 Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add the sliced onions and bell peppers, cook, stirring, until just barely tender, about 1-2 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pan to a bowl and keep warm.\n\n\n\n3 Heat an additional Tbsp of oil in the skillet on high heat, until the oil is shimmering, but not smoking.  Add the strips of beef let the beef brown initially, without stirring, but as soon as it is brown on one side, then stir.  Cook for no more than a minute (for medium-rare).  Add the peppers and onions, tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce and sesame oil and cook for a half minute longer, stirring.  Remove from heat.\n\nServe alone, or with steamed rice.  Salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Recipe updated September 6, 2012\nSometime in the mid-80s I gave my father a subscription to Gourmet Magazine for Christmas. I think this goes down in family history as the most appreciated gift ever given to him by one of his kids. He continued to subscribe to Gourmet for at least 15 years. Over the last few years, mostly to get ideas for this site, dad has been skimming through decades old issues that he still has in stashes all over the house. Here’s a recipe that started out from an old issue of Gourmet and used Worcestershire sauce, but over the years has morphed into something with a more Asian flare with soy sauce and sesame oil, and onions along with the strips of bell pepper. The original recipe called for chuck, we used top sirloin, which made the beef strips very tender, but because the strips are so thin, and cut across the grain, you could easily use chuck.\n
993	Simple Cooked Tomato Salsa	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put tomatoes, jalapeño, garlic, salt, and water into a blender.  Purée for 20 seconds, until completely liquified.\n\n\n\n2 Heat olive oil in a sauce pan on medium high.  Pour purée into pan.  Bring to a low simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture completely changes color from light red to a much darker red, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat.\n\nKeep refrigerated when not using.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My friend Arturo taught me how to make this simple salsa the other day. He calls it “Salsa Fresca”, which he says is what this salsa is called where he’s from in Mexico. What we in the states usually call salsa fresca, a chunky salsa with chopped fresh tomatoes, onions and chiles, is something completely different. Looking for similar recipes in some of Diana Kennedy’s books I find several references to “salsa de jitomate” or simply, “tomato salsa”, and none for salsa fresca. But that’s not surprising. The names for dishes, and even ingredients, can vary widely, depending on where you are in the country.\nFortunately, the salsa is more simple than its name’s etymology. And likely you’ve had it before, if you’ve ever stepped inside a taqueria. There you usually have a choice of salsas, one smooth, red, and hot, the other made with chopped fresh tomatoes, onions, and chiles. This would be the first, the smooth, red and hot one. It’s great for dipping tortilla chips, or over quesadillas.\n
994	Sweet and Sour Chicken	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a bowl, combine the chicken with the egg white, salt and cornstarch. Stir to coat the chicken evenly. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\n2 In the meantime, whisk together the pineapple juice, vinegar, ketchup, salt, and brown sugar.\n3 Heat a large frying pan or wok over high heat until a bead of water instantly sizzles and evaporates. Pour in the 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and swirl to coat. It's important that the pan is very hot. Add the chicken and spread the chicken out in one layer. Let the chicken fry, untouched for 1 minute, until the bottoms are browned. Flip and fry the other side the same for 1 minute. The chicken should still be pinkish in the middle. Dish out the chicken onto a clean plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\n4 Turn the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up and then add the bell pepper chunks and ginger. Fry for 1 minute. Add the pineapple chunks and the sweet and sour sauce. Turn the heat to high and when the sauce is simmering, add the chicken pieces back in. Let simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Timing depends on how thick you've cut your chicken. The best way to tell if the chicken is done is to take a piece out and cut into it. If it's pink, add another minute to the cooking.\nTaste the sauce and add more brown sugar if you’d like.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Please welcome guest author Jaden Hair of Steamy Kitchen who brings us another great Chinese-American classic, Sweet and Sour Chicken. ~Elise\nWhen Elise asked me to be a guest writer for Simply Recipes, we decided to take Chinese favorites and make them better, lighter and easier to cook at home. So, I grabbed a take-out menu from the local Chinese restaurant and I will be working my way around those recipes for you.\nIf there’s one thing that I detest, it’s greasy fried food covered in goopy Chinese take-out sauce. Okay, so sometimes I like that stuff, but it usually those cravings come at 3 o’clock a.m. during a certain time of the month.\nBut, I digress.\nThis recipe for Sweet and Sour Chicken doesn’t deep fry, but instead uses a method for creating a delicate, smooth and succulent chicken that goes perfectly with a lighter sweet and sour sauce. The secret is in the chicken marinade, specifically using egg white and cornstarch, which creates a super-light coating all around the chicken. It won’t be a crunchy, deep fried coating, but I think it’s a nice alternative, both texture-wise and weight-wise!\n\nJust like the Shrimp Fried Rice, a very hot pan is essential to making this Sweet and Sour Chicken so that the chicken can sear quickly. Heat your frying pan until a bead of water will sizzle instantly and evaporate on contact. Just flick a bit of water onto the hot pan and you should hear a “tssszzzaaaaa” as it hits the surface. If you don’t hear it, let it heat up a little longer. For some stoves, especially electric stoves, it can take as long as 3 minutes to heat up to the right temperature!\nOnce the pan is hot, then you can add your chicken. But make sure that you keep the chicken in a single layer and do not crowd. If you crowd the chicken, they will just steam and not sear in the pan.\nAnother important tip to stirfry is to have your meat at close to room temperature before cooking. This means leaving the chicken out to un-chill for about 15 minutes on the counter, which is the perfect amount of time for a short marinade. If you add cold chicken to a hot pan, not only will it stick to the pan, but the heat of the pan will be so busy warming up the chicken that it won’t have a chance to actually sear the meat right away.\nSo how sweet and how sour? The beauty of this dish is that you can adjust at the end. Have a little taste of the sauce. Not sweet enough? Add a spoonful of brown sugar. Not tangy enough? add a teaspoon of vinegar.\n
995	Pistachio White Chocolate Chip Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350 F. Cream the butter and sugars together on high speed for three minutes.\n2 Add the eggs, milk, and vanilla and beat for 3 minutes, being sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure even mixing.\n3 In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and rolled oats. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture slowly, being sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl once or twice to ensure even mixing.\n4 Fold in the pistachios and white chocolate chips. Drop heaping teaspoonfuls onto parchment lined cookie sheets, add an extra pistachio or two on top of each bit of dough for decoration if desired.\n5 Bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to set up on the cookie sheets before moving to a baking rack to cool completely.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Guest author Garrett McCord brought 2 dozen of these cookies over today. We inhaled them. ~Elise\nAlmost all of the pistachios grown in America are produced right here in California (we’re a lucky state, we are). It’s a surprisingly labor intensive crop that requires a lot of attention for yields that can greatly differ from year to year. Still, the crop is relatively new to the U.S.; up until 1976, almost all of the pistachios were imported from Iran until President Carter placed an embargo on the country. It was then California farmers started to plant the first pistachio trees here in America. Nowadays we can get pistachios from any local market and use their rich, mellow flavors as we please.\nThis cookie makes delicious use of pistachios, pairing them with white chocolate (or dark, should you so prefer). The original recipe came from an article in the Sacramento Bee by way of Jane Dewey, a wife of a local pistachio farmer. After a bit of tweaking I finally got them to come out the way I prefer them. I prefer using a brick of white chocolate and chopping it into chunks for a more rustic look, but white chocolate chips will do just fine. I also reduced the butter a bit and used kosher salt which gives a nice spark of contrast to the sweetness. Very chewy and amazingly good, I promise these cookies are keepers. \n
996	Grilled Wild Salmon with Preserved Lemon Relish	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Prepare relish. Combine all relish ingredients into a small bowl.\n2 Preheat grill for indirect heat.\n3 Check to make sure the scales have been removed from the salmon's skin. If scales remain, use edge of a large spoon, scrape against the sides of the fish, in the direction of tail to head, to remove any fish scales that may still be on the fish. (Best to work over a sink, as the scales tend to fly all over the place.) Rinse fish with cold water and pat dry.\n\n4 Put 1-inch deep, diagonal cuts in sides of the salmon, spaced 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart. Stuff the cuts well with relish. Stuff cavity with relish. (Note that if this uses up all of your relish, you may want to make another batch of it to serve alongside the fish.) Squeeze some lemon juice over the fish. Rub olive oil generously all over the fish (this will help keep it from sticking to the grill grates). Tie up the fish with kitchen string, to help hold it together while grilling.\n5 When the grill is good and hot, oil the grill grates. (Use tongs to spread oil over the grates with a folded up and oil-soaked paper towel.) Grill on indirect heat (away from coals or not directly over flame) for 20-30 min, turning half way. Try to keep the grill temperature at 350°F-375°F. Use a meat thermometer to test the fish, inserted into the deepest part. The fish is done when the internal temperature of the fish is 130°F.\nIf the skin comes off when you flip the fish, or when you remove the salmon from the grill, don't worry about it. Just peel it off before serving.\nServe with remaining fresh relish. A 2 lb half-whole salmon will serve 4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father walked through the door the other day with half of a fresh whole wild salmon, announcing to me that he would like me to grill it. Sure dad! When someone presents truly fresh fish to you, there really isn’t a “save it for another day” option. The thing to do is to keep it chilled and cook it as soon as you can. Save for tomorrow? Fuggetaboutit. Fresh fish should be cooked the day you get it. Now, according to my favorite grilling experts, Andrew Scholss and David Joachim (Mastering the Grill, excellent book, must have if you are into grilling), wild salmon is great to grill whole, and easier to do so than farmed salmon, because it tends to be thinner, easier to cook through without getting dried out on the edges.\n\nI packed this salmon with chopped preserved lemons, parsley, dill, and shallots, and grilled it on our gas grill. It was outstanding. One of the best salmon meals we’ve ever had. Leftovers great the next day with bread and butter pickles. Note, we often get our fish from Whole Foods, and unless you specifically ask for it, they sometimes forget to remove the scales before they hand you the fish. (This is not just in Sacramento, I’ve heard complaints from a friend in Boston too.) Bad, bad, bad, on the part of Whole Foods or any fish monger. You really shouldn’t have to ask, this should be done for you. But, in case it isn’t, you’ll want to remove the scales yourself before cooking the fish.\nNo cooked grilled fish photo this time. Got too dark. The photos were hideous. You’ll have to trust me on this one.\n
1002	Mrs. Paxton’s Raw Apple Cake	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 350 degree F.\n\n2 Beat together the sugar and oil.   Add the eggs.  In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.  Add dry ingredients to oil sugar eggs mixture in thirds, beating to incorporate after each addition.  Mix in the vanilla, apples, coconut, and chopped nuts.  \n\n3 Bake in a greased and floured bundt cake pan about 1 hour.  Test around the centers with a long thin bamboo skewer or toothpick to make sure the cake is done.\n\n4 When cool enough to handle, gently remove from pan.  Let sit on a rack to cool completely. If the dough has raised substantially around the middle areas of the bundt ring, you may need to use a bread knife to gently level off the cake so that it sits even.\n\n5 Blend glaze ingredients and cook until melted.  Place the cake on its serving dish.  Prick all around the top of the cake with a fork so that when the glaze is applied it easily seeps into the cake.  Use a pastry brush to apply the glaze liberally around the surface areas of the cake, or use a spoon to dribble the glaze on the cake.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	When it’s apple season here in Northern California, we are picking and processing daily from our trees (3 trees, 15 varieties). Of the many apple recipes we have on the site, this is one of my favorites. You simply cannot go wrong with this raw apple cake. The ingredients of coconut and the apples ensure that the cake will be moist and flavorful.\n
997	Apple and Sausage Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 425°F. Line the inside of a pie shell with heavy aluminum foil, pressing the dough against the side. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove foil, poke the bottom of the pie crust with the tines of a fork to create air vents. Return crust to oven, bake for an additional 4 minutes, or until the crust just begins to brown. Remove from oven and let cool.  Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.  \n\n2 Melt butter in a large skillet on medium heat.  Add the apples, onions, and sugar, cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes.  In the last 30 seconds or so, add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Transfer mixture to a separate bowl.  Increase the heat to medium high and in the same skillet add the Italian sausage.  Cook, stirring only infrequently, until sausage is browned on all sides and is cooked through.   Remove from heat.  Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a dish lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat.\n\n3 In medium sized bowl, mix together the cheeses and beaten eggs.\n\n4 Place sausage on bottom of pre-baked pie crust.  Add the cooked apple onion mixture over the sausage.  Pour the cheese egg mixture over the apple mixture and spread it so it evenly covers the pie.\n\n5 Bake at 350°F for 35 to 40 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	With apple season in full swing, and cooler weather on the way, here’s a casserole pie that combines sweet Italian sausage with Granny Smith apples, and a mix of cheeses. Our neighbor Pat (the wonderful neighbor who has been teaching me all about organic gardening) brought over this delicious casserole for a block party recently. What a hit!\n
998	Chicken Breasts with Mushroom Sage Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n1 Melt butter in a large sauté pan on medium high heat.  Add shallots and sauté for one minute.  Add mushrooms and parsley and sauté for 5-10 more minutes, until the mushrooms have browned.  If you are using unsalted butter, sprinkle on a pinch of salt.  Add vermouth and deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits that may be sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Stir in the cream.  Bring to a boil and cook the sauce down until it is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon (about 10 minutes).\n\n \n\n2 While the sauce is reducing, heat olive oil in another large sauté pan on medium high heat. Sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of the chicken breast cutlets.  Add cutlets to pan and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, until browned and cooked through.  \n\n3 Stir in sage to sauce, season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken to serve.\n\nServe alone (for low carb version) or with rice, mashed potatoes, or pasta (use gluten-free for gluten-free version).  We used bow-tie pasta which worked great.  Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	You know what the best thing is about boneless, skinless chicken breasts? They cook up in about nothing flat. Great for midweek meals when you are just rushing to get something on the table. Chicken breasts also take to sauces well, including this cream-based sauce loaded with mushrooms. What are your favorite sauces for chicken breasts? Let us know in the comments.\n
999	Cherry Tomato Cucumber Feta Salad	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGently toss the tomatoes, cucumber, feta, onions, mint, and oregano together.  Dress with lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Here it is September and this is the first cherry tomato salad I’ve had all summer. The culprit? My own greedy hands, the hands that pick them when I’m out in the garden and pop them in my mouth like candy. My father admits to the same. Some actually do make it into the kitchen, but then they are snacked away before anything resembling a dish can be made with them. We’ve had a resurgence of hot weather the last few days, which is good news for ripening tomatoes, and finally we’ve had a day when I picked more than I ate. Must have eaten lunch before harvesting, what a concept! Remember what they tell you about never going grocery shopping while hungry? The same holds true for gardening.\nThis is an easy salad to throw together, the base is tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta cheese. We used cherry and pear tomatoes and lemon cucumbers from the garden, and added some fresh mint, oregano, and shallots. Dressed with lemon juice and olive oil. You could also add some Kalamata olives and arugula if you want to get fancy.\n
1000	Lemon Mascarpone Blondies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter and flour an 8X8 pan. Whisk together the melted butter and sugar in a bowl.\n\n2 Add the egg and vanilla extract and whisk.\n\n3 Add the lemon juice, zest, and mascarpone cheese and mix thoroughly. \n\n4 Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, mix it all together.\n\n5 Pour into the pan and spread evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool on a wire rack. Cut into squares and serve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Guest author Garrett McCord brought these blondies over the other day, a variation of the blondies he made a few months ago. They were outstanding. They lasted all of 20 minutes. My father is still waiting for Garrett to bring him another batch. ~Elise\nThis is a take on my favorite blondie recipe after one of our commenters mentioned mixing in some lemon and mascarpone cheese. I was intrigued at the idea and went ahead and gave them a try. They are, to be succinct, astoundingly good. Creamy, sweet, very soft and with a bit of zing from the lemon they’re incredibly rich with a lot of flavor. A cookie that’s sure to satisfy the most insatiable sweet tooth. \n
1001	Smoked Salmon Bisque	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Melt butter in a medium stockpot over medium heat. Add onion, leeks, mushrooms, garlic and cook until onions are translucent and mushrooms have given up their moisture (7 to 10 minutes). \n\n2 Add the clam juice, smoked salmon, tomatoes (break up tomatoes while putting them in the soup), parsley, cilantro, dill, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and Old Bay seasoning;  cook until heated through. \n\n3 Put flour into a separate bowl.  Slowly add the milk, beating with a wire whisk until smooth.  Mix in the cream.   Stir cream flour mixture into the soup.  Stir in fresh salmon and simmer for 5 more minutes.  If you want, use an immersion blender to purée the soup, or pour some or all of the soup into a standing blender and purée.  Salt to taste.\n\nGarnish with fresh dill.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	A little trivia here. What makes a bisque a bisque and not a chowder? Both bisques and chowders are made with seafood and vegetables, with a cream base. Chowders tend to be more stew-like or chunky, and bisques puréed. Bisques are traditionally made with shellfish, though these days a puréed tomato, cream-based soup can be called a bisque too. We half-puréed this smoked salmon bisque, which accounts for the photograph. My father made this delicious soup the other day after being inspired by a bisque we had at a local bistro and wine bar. So creamy and good.\n
1003	Pear Ginger Maple Pie	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Roll out pie dough and place in a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie dish and place in the freezer to set.\n2 Preheat the oven to 400 F. Place the chopped pears in a large bowl with the cornstarch, candied ginger, brown sugar, maple syrup, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Toss well.\n\n3 Place the pear mixture into the chilled, crust lined pie dish and smooth the top of the fruit. Place the pie into the center oven rack and bake for 45 minutes. (Put a baking sheet on the rack under the pie to catch any drippings.) After 30 minutes, line the edges of the pie with foil or a pie protector to prevent them from burning.\n4 While baking take all the Oatmeal Crumb Topping ingredients and place them in a bowl. Use your hands and mix the ingredients until large crumbs form. Refrigerate until use.\n5 After 45 minutes reduce heat to 375F. Remove the pie and carefully place the crumb topping over the pie, covering all the fruit. Bake for another 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least one hour. Serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	This pear pie by guest author Garrett scored major points with my parents. Great pie! ~Elise\nEvery once in a while I see a recipe in a magazine at the doctor’s office or in the reception room of my work and tear it out with all good intention of making it at home. For the most part though I either lose the recipe, or it gets forgotten, or accidentally throw away. However, while perusing an issue of Family Fun magazine I came across a recipe for a pear and maple pie. Inspired, I called Elise right away and made plans with her to make this pie. With an appointment set, I knew this recipe wouldn’t get away.\nMy oh my, this is good pie. Sweet from the fresh pears and the maple syrup, it’s balanced by the snap from the candied ginger which helps give the pie a clear voice. The crumbly oatmeal topping is reminiscent of granola and provides a nice textural tête-à-tête with the fruit and crust. A wonderfully Autumn appropriate pear pie that’s a welcome change from apple!\n
1004	Chicken Pasta with Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat 4 quarts of salted* water in a large pot for the pasta. As the water heats, prepare the chicken. Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium high. Season the chicken pieces generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the chicken pieces, spreading them out initially and then not stirring them, so they have an opportunity to brown. Once lightly browned on one side, use tongs to flip the pieces over so they brown on the second side. When pieces are browned on both sides, and just cooked through, remove to a paper towel lined plate.\n2 Deglaze the pan with white wine. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken stock and let liquids reduce by half (turn up the heat if necessary). Add the cream, mint, thyme, lemon zest, honey, salt, and vinegar. Reduce the sauce by half again.\n3 Once the pasta water is boiling, add the pasta and cook following directions on pasta package. When pasta is ready, drain and add to cream sauce when cream sauce has been reduced by half and is thick enough to coat a spoon. Add chicken to the pasta and sauce. Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n* Use a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water. Some people wait until the water is boiling to add the salt. Makes little difference to me. Just make sure you get the salt in the pasta water or your pasta will be tasteless.\nServe immediately. Garnish with a little chopped fresh mint and thyme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We tried this thyme mint cream sauce from another recipe and loved it so much I decided to make it with chicken and pasta. Great flavor combination, and the kicker is that by the time the pasta water has come to a boil and the pasta is cooked, everything else is ready too, making for a filling, tasty midweek meal.\n
1005	Collard Greens with Bacon	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Cook the bacon in the skillet until it just begins to brown around the edges, stirring occasionally. Add the onions and cook until they have softened and are just starting to brown.\n\n2 Add the garlic, salt, pepper, sugar and hot sauce.  Cook until the garlic becomes fragrant, about a minute. Add the vinegar, bring to a simmer, and cook until the amount of liquid is reduced by half, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\n\n3 Add the collard greens and the chicken broth (or water) and bring to a simmer. Reduce the temp to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the collard greens have wilted and have lost their brightness. Season to taste with additional vinegar and hot sauce. Serve with some of the pan juices from the pan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	My father found this Louisiana recipe for collard greens in the Wall St. Journal earlier this year that we’ve now made several times. Each time I wonder why we don’t make them more often, they’re so good! The combination of the bacon, onions, sweetened cider vinegar and hot pepper sauce seem to neutralize the natural bitterness of the greens. Do you like collard greens? If so, what’s your favorite way of preparing them? Please let us know in the comments.\n
1012	Green Chile Cornbread	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat oven to 400°F.  Grease a 8x12 inch baking dish.\n\n2 In a large bowl mix the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda.  In a separate bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar.  Beat the sour cream and eggs to the butter sugar mixture.  Add the milk and the dry ingredients, a third at a time and alternating wet/dry. Mix in the green chiles, corn, and shredded cheese.  Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.\n\n3 Bake for 35 minutes, until top is browned, the center springs back when pressed down, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.  Let cool almost completely before serving.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Finally. A green chile cornbread that is moist, flavorful, and filled with corn and chiles. I’ve been experimenting for a couple of years now and believe we now have a winner. Do you like green chiles? I grew up eating Anaheims. They are best when roasted fresh over flame, but you can easily used the canned chiles. \n
1006	Marsala Poached Pears	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 In a saucepan just large enough to fit all of the pears, place the Marsala wine, sugar, lemon juice, star anise, cloves, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and place the pears in the pan, standing upright. Cover the pan and cook for 10 to 15 minutes (if you want, baste with the liquid a couple of times during the cooking), until the pears can easily be pierced with a fork. Very firm pears make need to cook for up to 20 minutes.\n2 Remove the pears to a serving dish. Keeping the pan uncovered, let the Marsala syrup boil down for a few minutes until it is a thick syrup. (If it begins to caramelize, remove pan from the heat and add a little water to the pan to stop the cooking.) Pour syrup over pears and serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Don’t you just love it when you put something together on a whim, and it works out the first time? My friend Garrett had a few extra pears from a baking adventure which I decided to poach in Marsala wine, with some sugar, star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. Star anise has a strong licorice flavor, so I was a little worried my poached pears would end up tasting like Good-n-Plenty. Fortunately, the other spices rose to the occasion and along with the Marsala infused the pears with a happy, spicy, delicious aroma.\n
1007	Mom’s Stuffed Bell Peppers	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 If you haven't already made the rice, start cooking the rice following the package instructions (usually 1 cup of raw white rice plus 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, bring to boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes.)\n\n\n\n2 Cut the tops off of the bell peppers.  Remove and discard (compost) the stem and seeds.  Place bell peppers cut side up on a steaming rack over an inch of water in a large covered pot.  Bring to boil, let steam for 10 minutes.  \n\n3 Heat oven to 350°F.  In a large bowl mix together the ground beef, basil, summer savory, marjoram, salt, several turns of black pepper, and rice.  \n\n\n\n4 Remove bell peppers from steamer pan.  Place cut side up in a pyrex or other oven-proof casserole.  Gently stuff the peppers with the ground beef rice mixture.  Drizzle olive oil over the stuffed peppers, along the outside of the peppers, and into the pan.  Rub the oil over the outside of the peppers; it will help with browning.  Sprinkle the tops generously with paprika.\n\n5 Place on middle rack and cook for 35-50 minutes, or longer, until the meat is cooked through.\n\nServe with ketchup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Stuffed bell peppers is one of those classic comfort food dishes that my family practically lived on when I was a kid. This recipe my mother got from Adele Davis as mom was teaching herself to cook in the 60s. Like so many of those early recipes, mom has modified them to her taste and style through the years. This one she rarely does exactly the same way twice, she’ll use a different set of herbs and seasoning depending on what strikes her fancy looking through the spice cabinet. Whereas my father is a stickler for details and exact ingredients measurements, mom usually can’t be bothered; she keeps things simple, and improvises as she goes along. While dad’s stuffed bell pepper recipe is terrific, it’s a little too much fuss and bother for her to make. This one is easier and more her style.\n
1008	How to Make Vanilla Extract	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Use kitchen scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut lengthwise down each vanilla bean, splitting them in half, leaving an inch at the end connected.\n2 Put vanilla beans in a glass jar or bottle with a tight fitting lid (mason jars work well). Cover completely with the vodka.\n3 Give the bottle a good shake every once in a while. Store in a dark, cool place for 2 months or longer.\nLasts for years. You can keep topping it off with vodka once in a while as you use it, just remember to give it a good shake.\nYou can also make vanilla sugar by putting a split vanilla bean into a jar of white, granulated sugar. Great way to infuse the sugar with vanilla flavor for baking.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Why make your own vanilla extract? Well let’s see. It’s easy to make. You’ll never run out of vanilla again. It might even be economical, given that you’ll never run out of it. It’s fun to watch the extract change colors? I don’t know. Sometimes we just make things for the heck of it. In this case, Garrett gave me a dozen or so vanilla beans, sharing what he had been given by this generous company. Vanilla beans are produced in several countries, and Garrett has a good write-up on his site regarding the differences between the varieties – Madagascar, Bourbon, Tonga, Mexico, Tahiti, etc.\n\nDid you know that each vanilla bean comes from an orchid that has been pollinated by hand? Once the vanilla seed pod has developed, it must be hand picked as well. After picking the curing process takes several months. So if you’ve ever wondered why vanilla extract, and especially vanilla beans, can be so expensive, this is why.\n
1009	Talerine Beef Casserole	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1  Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees and bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the egg noodles. \n\n\n\n2 Heat 2 Tbsp of oil on medium high heat in a large, heavy bottomed pot.  Add the onions and bell pepper and  sauté until softened.  Add garlic and cook for a minute more.  Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with your fingers or a knife, if you are using whole canned tomatoes.   Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes.  Lower the heat to warm. \n\n\n\n3 In a separate skillet, heat to medium-high.  Add a couple of tablespoons of oil to the pan and brown the meat, working in batches.  Break up about half of the ground beef into the pan.  Do not stir, but let sit and cook for a minute or two until brown.  Sprinkle a little salt over the meat while cooking. Once brown on one side, stir the meat a little to get the other sides browned.  Once the meat is thoroughly browned, use a slotted spoon to remove the meat from the pan and put it in with the tomatoes, onions, and peppers.  Brown the second batch of ground beef the same way.\n\n4 Using the same pan that you had used for browning the beef, sauté the mushrooms in the remaining oil and beef drippings.  Once browned, add the mushrooms to the beef and tomato mixture.\n\n5 While the mushrooms are cooking, add the egg noodle pasta to the boiling water.  Cook as directed, about 4-5 minutes.  Strain when cooked, but still a little firm (al dente).\n\n6 Add egg noodles, corn, chopped olives, and about two thirds of the cheese to the large pot of beef and tomato mixture.  Gently mix in.\n\n\n\n7 Transfer mixture to a large casserole dish, or to two casserole dishes if you don't have one that is large enough.  Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of casserole(s).  Place in the oven.  Cook for 30 minutes (can go as long as an hour).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	We’ve been in a nostalgic mood lately, thinking of some of our favorite dishes from years past. One that my father remembered that my grandmother used to make was a egg noodle ground beef casserole, with tomatoes, lots of cheddar cheese, corn, mushrooms, and olives. My brothers and I recall this dish as well, when my grandmother lived with us in Los Angeles in the 60s. We finally dug up grandma’s old hand written recipe; its name – Talerine. Doing a quick search on Google for “talerine” reveals several very similar recipes that many people coincidentally also got from their grandmothers. Does anyone know the origin of this dish, and the name? (Let us know in the comments.) It’s a great casserole – tasty, easy to make, hearty, can feed a lot of people.\n
1010	Applesauce	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Put all ingredients into a large pot.  Cover.  Bring to boil.  Lower heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes.\n\n2  Remove from heat.  Remove cinnamon sticks and lemon peels.  Mash with potato masher.  \n\nReady to serve, either hot or refrigerated.  Delicious with vanilla ice cream or vanilla yogurt.\n\nFreezes easily, lasts up to one year in a cold freezer. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	There is nothing better than homemade applesauce with hand-picked apples, and it is so easy to do! If you want chunky applesauce, use a potato masher to mash the cooked apples. If you prefer smooth apple sauce, run the cooked apples through a food mill. The key is adding a few strips of lemon peel to the apples while cooking. The lemon heightens the apple flavor.\n
1011	Pumpkin Cookies	\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Preheat the oven to 350° F.\n\n2 Beat the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\n\n3 Add the egg, vanilla, and pumpkin puree and beat for another 3 minutes.\n\n4 In a separate bowl combine the flour, oats, baking soda, salt, cardamom and cinnamon and whisk together. Slowly add it to the butter mixture until just combined, being sure to scrape down the sides and bottom once or twice to ensure even mixing.\n\n5 Fold in the pumpkin seeds and currants. Drop spoonfuls of dough on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake for 13-15 minutes. Allow to cool on the tray for a minute or two to set, then move to a wire rack to finish cooling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t	Have you ever gotten a tummy ache from eating too many cookies? I did with these pumpkin cookies from our guest author Garrett McCord. Too good. ~Elise\n“What the heck?” cried out my roommate looking at the dinner table now covered in produce.\n“What?”\n“Just how many squashes did you buy!?”\n“Only, like, seven. Enough to last us for most of Fall,” I replied. And really, is seven of them too many? I think not.\nOnce Autumn rolls around my kitchen becomes overloaded with butternuts, kabochas, ambercups, and turban squashes. Indeed I actually have extra baskets laid out on the dining table overflowing with knobby, colorful gourds ready to be cooked. Roasted, pureed, curried, it’s all good due to their playful versatility. Still, using them in baking is my preference; their rich flavors are tailor made for sweets.\nNow the commonplace pumpkin cookie is often too bready for me and usually covered in some too sweet glaze of sorts. It’s a cookie that I generally shy away from. This one however is a bit different thanks to a nice dose of oatmeal to keep it very soft and chewy. Furthermore, the use of cardamom, currants, and pumpkin seeds give it a curiously different and delightful taste from other pumpkin cookies. It’s a combination that’s a great way to use up any pureed squash and turn out a treat that everyone will love.\n
