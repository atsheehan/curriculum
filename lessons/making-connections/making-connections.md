#### Being Active on Social Media

The development community is active on social media. Get in on the conversation.

**Share useful links on Twitter and LinkedIn.** If you've found something useful or helpful, share it! Chances are it will help others as well.

**Reply to thoughtful comments on Twitter.** Start conversations with those that inspire or educate you. One thing that makes Twitter great is that everyone is accessible. Don't be bashful about sharing thoughts and ideas with those that are active in the community. They might respond or even retweet your reply if it adds value.

**Show GitHub activity.** Don't stop building! Launch Academy is just the first chapter of your new life as a software developer. It's critical that you keep your skills current and that you appear active while you're seeking jobs. Start a new breakable toy or find an open source project to get involved with!

**Avoid overly controversial and irrelevant topics.** Politics and religion can be very polarizing. In general, but especially while you're in the job search, avoid overly controversial and irrelevant topics. Also, be sure to keep your public personas clean of drug and alcohol use, profanity, and other unprofessional behavior. Just like we google how to fix Rails errors, hiring managers will google your name to find what comes up!

#### Create Content

In addition to showing GitHub activity, be sure to keep blogging. Talk about your interview experiences, your new projects, and other interesting topics. Show that Launch Academy was just the beginning in your exploration of technology and solving problems.

#### Being Memorable In Physical Interactions

When at events and during 1-on-1 conversations, be memorable and personable. Imagine that ever interaction brings you closer to your goals.

Share a memento like a business card with the other parties so that they can follow up with you, and so that they can recall their conversation with you.

#### Following Up

After having a meaningful interaction with someone, be effective with your follow up. Tie your message back to the context of the conversation you had. If you can, connect the person with someone or something of value to them. They will remember the goodwill you shared.

Again, effective follow up should be professional, grammatically correct, and genuine.

### Why This Is Important

We have learned that software is a collaborative industry. Developers and technology executives want to work with likable, collaborative people. Making connections is what will help you to secure positions at great companies.
