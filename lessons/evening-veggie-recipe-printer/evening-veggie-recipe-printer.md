## The Amazing Vegetarian Recipe Printer!

### Instructions

Write a program that prints out recipes in a particular format using Ruby and [Embedded Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) or `erb`. Your `.rb` file should contain the `recipe` variable below. The output of your code should follow the format noted below under `output`.

1. First produce the formatted output with plain Ruby.
2. Next produce the formatted output with `erb`. A short blog titled [Ruby's ERB Templating System](http://www.rrn.dk/rubys-erb-templating-system) could be helpful here.

### ERB

ERB is Embedded Ruby!

ERB allows us to embed Ruby code into strings or documents.

We can use ERB to evaluate and print. If we have a variable `name = "Dan"`, we can print out "Hello, Dan." like so:

```ruby
require "erb"

name = "Dan"
message = "Hello, <%= name %>."
erb = ERB.new(message)

puts erb.result  # => "Hello, Dan."
```

The following statement is evaluated using ERB, and the result is "Hello!":

```ruby
require "erb"

message = "
  <% if 5 >= 0 %>
    Hello!
  <% else %>
    Goodbye!
  <% end %>
"
erb = ERB.new(message)

puts erb.result  # => "Hello!"
```

The main benefit of ERB is the ability to create dynamically generated documents based on Ruby variables.

### Learning Goals

* Utilizing a hash to print human readable format on the screen.
* Make use of Ruby's `erb` library to print out data in specific format.

### Input

```ruby
recipe = {
  name: "Roasted Brussels Sprouts",
  ingredients: [
    "1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts",
    "3 tablespoons good olive oil",
    "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  directions: [
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Cut off the brown ends of the Brussels sprouts.",
    "Pull off any yellow outer leaves.",
    "Mix them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt and pepper.",
    "Pour them on a sheet pan and roast for 35 to 40 minutes.",
    "They should be until crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.",
    "Shake the pan from time to time to brown the sprouts evenly.",
    "Sprinkle with more kosher salt ( I like these salty like French fries).",
    "Serve and enjoy!"
  ]
}
```
