Write a method `def duplicate_counter(array)` that takes an array and returns a number that represents how many duplicate elements were in an array:

* `duplicate_counter([1, 7, 7, 7, 3, 5])` would return `2` because there are 2 sets of duplicate `7`s.
* `duplicate_counter([5, 7, 9])` would return `0` because there are no duplicate elements.
* `duplicate_counter([0,-5,-5,33,33,33])` would return `3` because there are 3 sets of duplicates (1 set of `-5`s and 2 sets of `33`s).

Notes:

* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
