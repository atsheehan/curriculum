### The Job Search

It's time to begin the search for your first web development position. Executing an intense and well-timed search is critical to your success at Launch Academy.

> "Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen."

-Michael Jordan

Launch Academy and the community around you have done all we can to get your ready for your first job as a web developer. Acquiring that position, however, is ultimately up to you. It's important to mentally commit to the task, and to have a firm plan for how you will meet that commitment.

In this assignment, we'll share some tips on how to conduct your job search.

#### Don't Stop Building

You must continue to build your GitHub portfolio! Demonstrate that learning to become a web developer is a lifelong endeavor, not just a short term one!

Try new technologies and start new projects. Get involved in an open source project, or start your own.

The key is to demonstrate that you're passionate about continuing building, whether for pay or for pleasure.

#### Personal Network, First

Tell everyone you know that you're seeking a web development position. You are [40% more likely to land an interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/employers-increasingly-rely-on-internal-referrals-in-hiring.html?_r=1&) if you're referred through an inside connection. You'd be surprised! Utilize Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social networks to let everyone know that you're looking for a position. A loose connection might have a friend of a friend that could provide you with the "in" that you need to land the job interview. Be sure to sure to update your personal site as well as your online profiles to reflect that you are seeking a web development position.

Don't be bashful about requesting introductions. If someone you know is connected to the Director or Engineering at a local company you're interested in, ask if they can put you in touch. Ensure they have enough information to appropriately introduce you. A request might look like this:

```no-highlight
Hey Joan,

I noticed you're connected with Sam Wise at Acme, Inc. Do you know him well? Would you mind connecting us?

I just graduated from Launch Academy (www.launchacademy.com) last week and I'm actively pursuing a web development position. I noticed Sam's company has a job listing out for a junior web development role (www.examplejobboard.com/web-dev-position).

I've attached my resume, and my LinkedIn URL is (http://www.linkedin.com/johnny-smith). A good representation of what I can build can be found at http://www.github.com/johnny-smith.

I realize it's a big ask, but I'd really appreciate your help. I really think I could be a huge asset for Acme, Inc., and I'd love the opportunity to prove that to Sam.
```

#### Community Involvement Is Not a Nice to Have

How do you establish more "inside" connections? Get active in the community! We've encouraged you to attend events with [BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org) [as](http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/) [well](http://www.meetup.com/javascript-2/) [as](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/) [some](http://webinnovatorsgroup.com/) [others](http://openhack.github.io/boston/). Find other groups that interest you. [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) is a great resource for discovering new organizations to check out.

Unfortunately, events can be very hit or miss. You will never know, though, how enjoyable an event will be unless you go! Try to attend at least two events per week while you're conducting your job search. We strongly recommend having an "event buddy" to keep you accountable and motivated to attend.

Don't be afraid to step up and assume a leadership role. Many organizers need help, so don't be bashful about lending a hand if the organization really interests you. If you do commit, however, be sure to follow through as committing without follow through will tarnish your reputation.

Be on the lookout for other one-time events. Hackathons, open houses, and socials are great ways to make connections.

[Greenhorn Connect](http://www.greenhornconnect.com/events/calendar) has a great event calendar as does [BostInno](http://bostinno.streetwise.co/events/).

**Attend Conferences**. [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby/) has a great listing of upcoming conferences. As a newcomer and job seeker, you might qualify for student discounts.

**Don't limit yourself to in-person meetings**. Get active in tech-specific online forums and communities.

Some active forums:

* [https://railsforum.com/](https://railsforum.com/)
* [https://www.ruby-forum.com/](https://www.ruby-forum.com/)

**Use you newly acquired skills for good**. There are many nonprofits, schools, and organizations that need web development help. Offer up your services and use the work you've done as part of your portfolio of professional work. After you've helped someone or an organization out, ask that they share with their friends that you're seeking a role in web development.

There are many groups that could probably connect you with an emerging need, but asking around in your personal network will likely result in success.

* [New Urban Mechanics](http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/)
* [Code For America](http://codeforamerica.org/)
* [Code For Boston](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Boston/)

#### Job Sites

* [GitHub Jobs](http://jobs.github.com/)
* [Stack Overflow Jobs](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs)
* [RubyNow](http://jobs.rubynow.com/)
* [AngelList](https://angel.co/)

#### Cast a Wide Net

Apply to a range of positions. Spend roughly 40% of your time applying to your top jobs, and use the rest of the time applying to other jobs that are easier to get. These jobs will serve as confidence boosters, interview practice, and backup strategies should your top picks not work out.

You should consider roles with the following titles:

* Software Developer
* Front End Developer
* Ruby Developer
* Rails Developer
* Software Engineer
* Application Engineer
* QA Engineer
* Quality Assurance Engineer
* UI Developer
* Junior Product Manager
* Junior Project Manager
* Junior DBA
* Junior Business Analyst
* Associate Business Analyst
* Web Analytics Intern
* Developer Evangelist
* Development Internship
* Support Engineer

Depending on the company, you should consider support positions. Remember, the key here is to establish a foothold in an organization so that you can demonstrate your skills as a developer.

Don't let the list of requirements in the listing bum you out! If you have half of the requirements, apply. Your job will be to sell why you're worth it during the phone screen and interview. If the job says "Computer Science Degree or equivalent experience", apply. This is used to screen out those that have just begun to code.

#### Completing the Application Productively

Read the instructions for applying extremely carefully. Your attention to detail here qualifies you for the position.

On the online front, you're really striving for quantity over quality. Establish a template that you can reuse as you apply for each job.

You'll want to have a resume, and a cover letter template drafted.

#### Your Cover Letter Template

The key to the cover letter is to tie your personal experiences and abilities to the needs of the role and the business. That's how it should start, and each cover letter needs to be tailored to the role and business you're applying to. The remaining sections of the cover letter should be reusable.

The items to customize:

* The role itself
* The company name
* The contact name (if supplied)
* A reason you like the company
* A reason you like the role, and a specific justification of why you're uniquely positioned to fill the role

The key is to attract attention with a personalized response, and to bolster you case with more reusable content.

Let's say John Smith was applying to [37Signals](http://37signals.com/). When applying, it's always best to address a specific person. If the ad identifies who has posted it, be sure to address them directly. If it's not immediately clear who has posted the ad specifically, address the hiring manager.

```no-highlight
Dear Hiring Manager,

---Custom Section
I wanted to submit my resume and convey my interest in the Developer role found @ http://www.jobs4me.com/rails-developer. I've been a long time admirer of 37Signals. In fact, we used Basecamp extensively as part of our partner projects at Launch Academy! As you'll see based on my resume and through my code examples, the philosophies that Launch Academy have taught me are well aligned with the way in which 37Signals builds software.

Due to my previous position as an effective inside sales rep, I have a unique perspective on how a customer would use such a product. I'd love to share some specific thoughts I've had on some small interface tweaks that would make things easier for salespeople.
---End Custom Section

---Boilerplate
During my time at Launch Academy, I build a responsively designed pomodoro timer that heavily incorporates JavaScript and websockets. I learned a lot about the realtime web and JavaScript performance issues that can arise on mobile devices. As part of my partner project, we build a great application that incorporates OmniAuth and GitHub-based authorization. You can find these applications at http://github.com/anApp and http://github.com/bApp respectively. As you'll see from my code examples, I'm a huge proponent of test driven development as well as other Agile methodologies.

Prior to studying at Launch Academy, I was an inside sales rep for Spacely Sprockets. For 3 years, I exceeded my quotas by 25% and also overhauled our follow up process resulting in a 30% response rate improvement.

I'd love to share more about my background with you and to show you that I strive to exceed expectations in everything that I do. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
John Smith

---End Boilerplate
```

At steady state, it should take you roughly five minutes to apply to an open position.

#### Following Up

A week after your application, it is critical that you follow up if you have not heard back.

Effective follow up accomplishes many things:

* **It reminds hiring managers who you are** - hiring managers will receive at least dozens of applications for the job. It's easy for you to get lost in the shuffle.
* **It shows interest and desire** - hiring managers don't like to get spammed with passively interested applicants. Demonstrating a genuine interest in the role and the company is a surefire way to show the hiring manager that you have character and that you want to get things done.
* **It separates you from the pack of job seekers** - most jobseekers will be too squeamish or too lazy to follow up. Checking back in sets you apart as someone that is genuinely interested in the role.

A follow up email should:

* **Be brief and professional**
* **Serve as a reminder as to why you're a fit**
* **Indicate that you're interested in hearing back, one way or the other**

Great follow up could also include:

* **A suggestion to get together**
* **Indicate that you're still following the company**

Here's an example follow up:

```no-highlight
Hello again Mr. Lumberg,

I wanted to check in and ensure that you received my application. I'm really interested in the role and I'd love to chat more about it. Since I've seen the listing, I've been working on an EmberJS application that is roughly in the same domain @ https://wwww.github.com/awesomeEmberApp. I'm picking things up quickly, but I'm still getting the hang of writing good, client-side controllers.

I noticed one of your engineers, Jane, contributed a patch to ember-appkit. It really helped me with the example application I built.

If there's anything I can help to clarify or expand upon pertaining to my background and interest in the role, please don't hesitate to reach out. If you don't think I'm a fit, your feedback would really aid my job search. Either way, please let me know.

Best,
John Smith

```

#### Streamlining Your Follow Up

As we've mentioned, applying to jobs is a numbers game. With a high volume of applications, it's critical you keep track of who you need to follow up with.

* [followup.cc](http://www.followup.cc/) is a great way for you to keep track of emails that require follow up. Each time you submit an application via email, bcc 1week@followup.cc so you'll be reminded to follow up.
* Use a google calendar or a productivity tool like [Asana](http://asana.com) to track when and who needs to be followed up with.

#### Timing Your Application and Follow Up

Arguably this is a micro-optimization, but you may want to consider the time and day that you submit an application. You can use a great tool like [Boomarang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/) to schedule when an email goes out.

Generally, it would be best to send emails early weekday mornings. It is not a great idea to send an email during the weekend as it will get lost amongst the weekend catch up.

#### It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint

Set goals and keep yourself accountable to them. You should endeavor to apply to more than 25 jobs each week.

It can be disheartening to not hear back or to be rejected. Remember that all it takes is 1 opportunity for you to start your web development career. Keep fighting for it, and utilize Launch Academy staff to make the most of your search!

### Rules to Follow

#### Personal Connection Trumps Blind Application

Personal connections will give you distinct advantage over other applicants! Expand your network through social media and community involvement to get the "in" you neeed.

#### Nothing Good Comes Without Effort

Finding a job is hard work! You must be committed to the task and willing to work for it.

#### Be Systematic

Create a system that makes it easy to track where you've applied and who you need to follow up with. If you apply to a job twice, it will be perceived as sloppy. Also, be sure to read every detail of how the company would like for you to apply.

#### Follow Up!

Always follow up on your application. Time can create unique opportunity. For example, maybe they've filled the role but they're considering opening up a new position. Your follow up could be well timed positioning you for success.

#### The Details Matter

Check your spelling, grammar, and the names of the people you're addressing. Clerical errors and lack of attention to detail will immediately disqualify you for the role.

### Why This Is Important

Let's put the amazing skills you have learned at Launch Academy to work! You've worked hard to acquire them, so work equally as hard (if not more) to get the job they empower you to perform.
