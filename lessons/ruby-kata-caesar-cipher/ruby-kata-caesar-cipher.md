Write a method `def caesar_cipher(string, number)` that takes a string and a number as an argument and returns a string based on the following requirements:

* Shift each letter in the string `number` spots down the alphabet. For example, running `caesar_cipher("a", 2)` would return `"c"`. `caesar_cipher("z", 2)` would return `"b"`. `caesar_cipher("Caesar", 2)` would return `"Ecguct"`.

* Punctuation, capitlization and spacing should be unchanged. Numbers also remain unchanged.

Notes:

* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
