#Write a palindrome checker

Write a method `def palindrome?(string)` in `code.rb` that takes a string as an argument and returns `true` or `false` based on the input.

A *palindrome* is a string that is the same forwards as backwards. The following are examples of *palindromes*:

```
A Santa at NASA
racecar
eye
Acrobats stab orca
anna
```

* Assume that punctuation and numbers will not be part of the string. Ignore capitalization (i.e., `A` should be treated like `a`) and spaces.
