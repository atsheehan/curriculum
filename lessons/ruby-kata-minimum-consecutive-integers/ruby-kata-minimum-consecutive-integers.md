Write a method `def minimum_consecutive_integers(array)` that takes an array of integers and returns the minimum number of integers required to make `array` consecutive. Consider the following examples:

* `minimum_consecutive_integers([1, 3])` would return 1 because there is 1 integer (`2`) which needs to be inserted in order for the sequence to be consecutive.

* `minimum_consecutive_integers([2, 5])` would return 2. `3` and `4` would need to be inserted to make the array a consecutive sequence.

* `minimum_consecutive_integers([-1, 4])` would return 4. `0`, `1`, `2` and `3` would be inserted to make the array a consecutive sequence.

Notes:

* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
* Assume each inputted `array` would have a minimum of 2 elements.
