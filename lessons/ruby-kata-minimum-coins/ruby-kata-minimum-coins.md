Write a method `def minimum_coins(number)` which takes a number as an argument (ranging from 1 to 250) and returns the minimum number of coins needed to calculate `number`. Coins here represent the following values: 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100. Consider the following examples:

* The minimum number of coins to generate `35` would be 2: 10 and 25.
* The minimum number of coins to generate `37` would be 4: 1, 1, 10, 25.
* The minimum number of coins to generate `101` would be 2: 1 and 100.

Notes:

* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
