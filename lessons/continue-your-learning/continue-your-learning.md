In this article, you will take specific action to optimize your next steps as a life long learner.

#### Co-work at Mission Control

You are welcome at Mission Control any time after 2PM on weekdays. Please note that the Experience team might have other obligations, but usually someone is around to help if you provide the team with advanced notice.

#### Form Study Groups

Just because you've graduated, we think the collaborative learning does not have to stop! There are many benefits:

* **It keeps you accountable** - having regular get-togethers will require you to make measurable progress to keep up with the rest of the group.
* **It keeps you focused** - it's easy to get lost in the sea of information and learning material out there. Having a group that agrees to review specific resources will help to minimize the sense of overwhelm.
* **It is more fun** - learning alone can be a drag. Learning together keeps you motivated and makes the process more enjoyable. Being able to ask someone else questions and having someone to relate with will also accelerate your learning curve.

Here are some key steps to forming study groups:

1. **Schedule meetups at least once per week** - the more you meet up, the more you'll feel obligated to keep up with the pace of the group. It also provides a means to get help more quickly when you need it.
1. **Set goals** - set [SMART goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) for what the group is setting out to accomplish. Ensure that for every meeting, there are tangible milestones for everyone to hit.
1. **Keep people accountable** - in order for everyone to get the most value out of the study group, each individual must do their part to get the work done.
1. **Code together** - it can be easy to fall into a pattern of just getting together to socialize and to talk about what you're learning. Remember to learn by doing. Pair program, perform code reviews, and do your best to center the conversation around the technology you're learning.
1. **Celebrate accomplishment** - when you meet your goals, have a [celebration](http://www.ibm5100.net/ref/src/1396695922471.jpg)! Congratulate everyone in the group on a job well done! Have dinner together, have a party, or do something fun together to serve as a great way to punctuate all the hard work.

#### Review Horizon Material and Rebuild Projects

Revisit the curriculum from the course. Identify where your conceptual strengths and weaknesses are. For the weaker areas, revisit the review assignments and complete the challenge a second time. Disregard any source code you have previously written to make the most from the learning experience. When done, compare your new version to your old one. Ask:

* Where did the code quality improve?
* What did I miss?
* What am I still struggling with as it pertains to this concept?

Repeat this process if necessary. Then, seek assistance and clarity via post-grad support.

#### Code, Daily

Do [code katas](http://sputnik.launchacademy.com/) and [ruby challenges](http://www.codewars.com/) daily for at least 45 minutes per day.

[RubyQuiz](http://rubyquiz.com/) is also great for daily practice.

#### Learn JavaScript

As of right now, our favorite resource for learning JavaScript is [A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology-ebook/dp/B00H1W9I6C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1398545945&sr=8-2&keywords=javascript&tag=ensolinc-20).

For additional practice with JQuery and DOM manipulation, we recommend CodeSchool's [Try JQuery Course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery) and its follow on, [JQuery: The Return Flight](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery).

We also recommend: [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/) and [JS The Right Way](http://jstherightway.org/).

#### Learn Algorithms

Algorithms will improve upon the Computer Science fundamentals that you have learned during the course. We recommend both [a coursera course taught by Princeton faculty](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) and a [a coursera course taught by Stanford faculty](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo). If the Princeton one is offered first, take that.

If those courses are not available, or if you're looking to supplement that education, there is a wonderful [PDF on Data Structures and Algorithms](http://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS240/ConciseNotes.pdf) that is ruby based.

#### Improve Your Ruby Literacy

[Practicing Ruby](https://practicingruby.com/) provides a great to level up your understanding of Ruby.

#### Improve Your Understanding of Rails

There is a [great list of questions that come up during interviews](http://anilpunjabi.tumblr.com/post/25948339235/ruby-and-rails-interview-questions-and-answers), but the best way to learn about Rails is to continue building applications.

### Why This Matters

Show the world that you are a life long learner. The course is only your first step in a lifetime of learning and growing as a professional software developer.
