### Learning Objectives

* Prepare for career day
* Learn how to follow up with employers

### Career Day

Career Day is an opportunity to showcase everything you have learned at Launch Academy. Use it as an opportunity to make connections with companies that are interested in hiring you!

In this assignment, we'll share how to make the most of your experience.

#### Preparation: Your Speech

You have a limited amount of time to share something about yourself, and to offer something unique and interesting about you.

You **should** share:

* Your full name
* Where you are from
* What your breakable toy / screencasted project is and why you built it.
* A specific challenge with the toy and how you overcame it

You **can** share:

* Why you want to become a web developer
* Another architectural challenge and how you overcame it
* What type of role you'd like to acquire
* The coolest thing you've learned at Launch Academy, and why you thought it was so cool
* What you're currently studying
* Additional side projects. This can include Ship it Saturday projects or review projects.

The key here is to speak confidently without rushing through the presentation.

The introduction might look something like this:

> Hi my name is Jane Smith, and I'm from Hoboken, New Hampshire. My breakable toy is called webodoro, and it is a pomodoro timer built for all of the modern devices of today. I built this breakable toy because I am fanatical about being productive and because I wanted to learn more about responsive web design.

**People love a story**. What story will you tell? Drawing from the bullet points above in what you can share, here's how Jane might walk through the rest of her speech.

> I came to Launch Academy as a dabbler that always knew enough to be dangerous, but it wasn't quite enough to build anything of consequence. In my previous life as a widget marketer, there were so many problems I encountered where technology was the main impediment. For example, it would take us two weeks to get a piece of content updated on the site! Frustrated by this issue and other inefficiencies, I wanted to be the person that fixed these types of problems. My experience at Launch Academy is exactly what I needed to get to the next level. During my time here and while I was constructing my breakable toy, I encountered many obstacles, mainly around understanding JavaScript performance and how it affects battery life on mobile devices. After research and guidance, I overcame this issue by discovering everything jQuery had to offer. I've also learned how important it is to have automated tests to help guide me towards what an end user wants. Working with capybara has helped to keep me focused on what we should all be focused on: delivering business value. It has been an amazing discovery process, and I'm fascinated by how many new doors are open for me as a technologist. I'm looking forward to learning more about client side MVC frameworks, and to joining an incredible team that wants to learn and grow with me.

This presentation has all the qualities of a good story. Make yourself the protagonist in your own story! A great story always has the conflict facing the protaganist, the resolution or climax, and the happy ending.

When introducing the conflict, try to keep it positive. A conflict of "My boss sucked and I wanted a piece of technology to help me avoid working with him" would not be the right start to this type of story! It should be some adversity that you faced personally or professionally that hindered you from accomplishing a goal.

The resolution or climax should indicate your ability to learn and acquire skills.

The happy ending should indicate how far you've come and what part of your future is most exciting to you.

Don't be afraid to introduce some emotion into it. "I've made so many friends here and I've learned how collaborative software can be", or "The connections I've made with my peers and the skills I've learned will have a lasting impact on me" are all great things to say, but the key is to make it genuine and heartfelt.

#### Preparation: Your Screencast

You can use [Quicktime's Screen Recording Feature](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4024) to record a 90 second to 2 minute screencast of your featured project. It should feature no audio and should give a good perspective of your breakable toy. Cover the most interesting and architecturally complex aspects of your application.

Record this screencast when your application has been properly styled and the "happy path" functions without errors.

This screencast will be played while you are presenting. Do not try to coordinate your speech with the screencast. The screencast is meant to be passively observed as you present and share your story.

#### Preparation: Learn About the Companies

Do your homework! We'll provide a list of companies as well as who will likely be attending in advance of career day.

* Use your google-fu to learn more about the company, attendees, and executives of the participating companies.
* If they have a publicly available application, kick the tires and play around with it.
* Review the company's social media and online presence, to understand the current events of the company.

The key is to have specific things to talk about when an informal conversation starts.

> "Hey your CTO, Sam, looks like a smart guy. I really enjoyed his blog post on controller testing. We don't do a ton of that at Launch Academy, and he really made me interested in it. I would really like to work with someone that writes a lot about what they're learning and observing in the market."

> "I noticed the company just forged a partnership with Spacely Sprockets. Man, I love their sprockets! I have forty. How is it going and where do you see that partnership taking you?"

> "I thought it was so cool that your company outing was white water rafting in New Hampshire. I recently went and it was a ton of fun. A company that emphasizes such strong culture like that is really exciting to me."

**Target companies**. Invest more time in the companies where you think you would be the best fit. Learn as much about the founders, the executives, and the career day attendees as you can.

Put together some notes, or assemble a "cheat sheet" for the attending companies so that you have the information readily accessible when the actual day comes.

#### At Career Day

Bring a notebook or padfolio with you, along with a professional pen or pencil. You should also have something tangible to give hiring companies. That could be a business card, resume, or other item that would allow a representative to recall their interaction with you.

Dress to suit the occasion. It is important to match the culture of the companies present.

For men, you should wear dress pants or clean, dark jeans, and a collared shirt, or a button down with an undershirt. Do not wear white socks, and donâ€™t forget a color coordinated belt. Also, do not come overdressed! Suits should not be worn.

For women, dark jeans with a nice blouse and blazer or an appropriate length dress with ballet flats or low to mid-rise heels and a cardigan is appropriate.

Ensure what you wear is neatly pressed or ironed. Wear shoes, not sneakers, but do not wear a tie.

Be memorable and be unique! The speeches are great conversation starters, but it's the informal dialog that will leave a lasting impression. Listen carefully and don't rush to dominate the conversation.

If you're truly interested in a particular company, don't be afraid to convey it.

> "I saw the Springfield Nuclear Plant on the list of hiring partners and I was really excited! I hear you're doing some pretty awesome stuff with Ember. I have a lot of respect for Barney, who has been blogging a lot about your use of ember-data."

When you've connected with someone, make a note to follow up with them in a meaningful way.

For example, Joe from Acme, Inc. might have shared that he was leaving for a ski trip after career day. On the back of their business card or in a notebook, write down "Joe from Acme - leaving for a ski trip for the weekend. Back in the office Monday."

#### Following Up

Equipped with notes from the event, you can meaningfully follow up with everyone you connected with. The example below would be a good example of an email follow up from the contrived encounter with Joe from Acme, Inc.

```no-highlight
Hey Joe,

How was your ski trip? I hope conditions were good! It looked like you had some good sun so hopefully it wasn't too cold.

I wanted to reach out and let you know it was an absolute pleasure meeting you at Launch Academy's career day. Acme, Inc. sounds like a great place to work, and I really think I could add value as part of your front end engineering team. I'll leave it to Corinne (cc'd) to follow up with you about next steps, but I did want to personally share my interest in getting to know you and Acme, Inc. better!

Best,
John Smith
```

### Rules to Follow

#### Be memorable

Hiring managers meet a lot of people, and they'll have many interactions during career day. Offer something unique and interesting about yourself so you will be remembered. Effective followup also helps with recall, so be sure to make a note of interesting things that were shared to help your odds.

#### Be human

No one wants to hire a robot! Display enthusiasm, smile, and laugh. Share your struggles and your triumphs to make meaningful connection.

#### Be genuine

Don't fake it! Hiring managers are just like anyone else. They can detect when you're being fake. This is an immediate way to turn someone off from the start. Share your enthusiasms where it's warranted, but don't feign strong interest if it's just not there.

### Why This Matters

Making an impression matters. Use the skills that you've learned at Launch Academy to communicate well and to make connections! It is through meaningful interaction that you will acquire a position.
