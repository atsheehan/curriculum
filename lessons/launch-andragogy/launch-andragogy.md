##Andragogy

#### What is andragogy? How is it different from pedagogy?

According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy), Angdragogy is the process of engaging adult learners with the structure of learning experience.

Andragogy is distinctly different from pedagogy in that it focuses on how adults learn, as opposed to children. Adults learn in distinctly different ways, mainly because their motivations are different.

Wikipedia summarizes Malcolm Knowles' theories of motivation in adult learners:

1. **Need to Know** - Adults need to know the reason for learning something
2. **Experience** - Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
3. **Self-Concept** - Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
4. **Readiness** - Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
5. **Orientation** - Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
6. **Motivation** - Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.

These 6 elements compose the foundations of our educational approach and model.

1. **Need to Know** - Every review assignment starts and ends with the 'Why' - each review assignment starts with a **Learning Objectives** section and a **Why This Matters** section.
2. **Experience** - Our learn by doing approach, along with our breakable toy, orients learning around play, experimentation, and learning from mistakes. Each Launcher brings a unique and individual approach to these experiments due to their prior experiences.
3. **Self Concept** - Our adaptive, learner-centered approach is what sets Launch Academy apart. We crave feedback. Part of owning your experience at Launch Academy is keeping us in the know as it pertains to your progress and where there are gaps in your knowledge.
4. **Readiness** - Launch Academy takes out all the nonsense - you will learn what you will need to know to become an effective web developer. Remember that time when you were sitting in a classroom thinking "I'm never going to use this?" That should not happen at Launch Academy. It's all about positioning you towards the pursuit of a new career in software development.
5. **Orientation** - Our learn by doing approach confronts you with problems. Our confidence in you places you in a position where you must use your resources to identify and create solutions.
6. **Motivation** - Your acceptance to the program was significantly based on your internal desire to become a software developer. You thrive on the immediate gratification of a job well done, and you don't need a personal cheerleader to get there.

#### Approach

##### The Dreyfus Model

Our objective is to take you from a novice to proficiency in the 10 weeks we have together. According to the Dreyfus model, that means you should be able to independently troubleshoot and learn on your own following the program.

The Dreyfus model defines a series of phases in learning: Novice, Competence, Proficiency, Expertise, and Mastery. The two skills you should be looking to incrementally develop are **active decision making** and subsequently **intuition**.

Active Decision Making is the process of digesting a body of knowledge and deciding on the best course of action.

Intuition will involve the developer conscience we want to cultivate. As you learn best practices and techniques, you will start to "feel" what is the wrong way of accomplishing a task vs. an acceptable way.

These two abilities will allow you to independently troubleshoot issues when faced with a technical problem. This troubleshooting capability is what separates an effective junior developer vs. an unsuccessful one.

Additionally, the Dreyfus Model stipulates that individuals learn most effectively from folks that are one or two steps ahead of them. That is why our experience engineers have a mixed variety of seniority.

##### The Zone of Proximal Development

Our approach is to incrementally build your base of knowledge.

At the start of the course, there are technical tasks that you will not be able to do without a base of knowledge. That base must be expanded upon through guided instruction and practice. The ability to complete these tasks have already started developing during prework. Your development towards the ability to complete these tasks will correlate with what you have previously learned with guidance. As your technical ability develops, you'll have the capability to surmount increasingly complex tasks. Thus, the innermost circle of the above diagram will expand rapidly, thereby increasing the total area of attainable knowledge.

##### Optimizing Learning Velocity

The speed by which we can increase the total area of attainable knowledge in the zone of proximal development is what we call **learning velocity**. In education, this is often referred to as **metacognition**, which is effectively the ability to learn new things.

As you grow as a technologist, your ability to learn new, technical things will increase. So much of this course focuses on cultivating your ability to find your own answers at increasing levels of efficacy, and that has a direct effect on your ability to perform in your new career.

You will notice that the way in which the experience team interacts with you will change throughout the course. We will initially provide many rules and a lot of structure towards accomplishing technical feats. As the course progresses, we will provide a decreasing amount of rules and an increasing amount of coaching. In navpoint Echo, the experience team will coach you to make calculated decisions.

##### The Gradual Release of Responsibility

As we progress through the course, we will start with a lot of structure. The learning process will be driven primarily by us as we supply you with rules and techniques for you to build upon. At an accelerating rate, we will give you looser direction so that much the responsibility of learning is passed to you.

##### To Play is To Learn

The course is structured around play and experimentation. Our projects, as well as some of instruction, will sometimes involve games. Learning science tells us that learning through play increases learning velocity.

There is a key word in the term "Breakable Toy," and that is **breakable**. We're hopeful that you will see your breakable toy as a safe place to experiment. Provided you utilize source control in an effective way, it is very easy to undo a mess made during experimentation.

Make those messes! It is through this experimentation where the learning really happens! Launch Academy is a safe place for you to experiment with code.

##### To Teach is To Learn

Beyond play and experimentation, it is important to flex those communication muscles! Software is very much about communication and people. Knowledge is truly gained when you can teach a peer something useful.

Endeavor to understand concepts to the point where you can teach it. It is a lot harder than it seems!

We will provide formal opportunities throughout the course to teach others, but there is infinite opportunity to teach your peers in the next 10 weeks.

##### To Collaborate is To Learn

Learning is best done in groups, and software is typically developed via small teams. We will require you to become increasingly collaborative because it helps to accelerate learning, and because it orients you with what life will be like when working as a software developer. In this course, we'll help you to focus on overcommunicating and being part of a team.

##### Own Your Experience

This course is oriented around optimizing your learning and progress, but ultimately your success is up to you. Owning your experience is about taking personal responsibility for achieving your outcomes.

This includes:

* Putting the necessary time in.
* Getting help when you need it.
* Accurately representing your progress and knowledge.
* Doing things you wouldn't typically do.
* Working on your weaknesses in addition to your strengths.
* Being social, active and engaged with your peers and your community.
* Giving candid feedback on how the course is working for you.

##### Community Involvement Is Not a Nice to Have

We have wonderful technical and innovation communities here in Boston. Take initiative and get involved. Our experience staff can help you find great user groups, startup related meetups, as well as random, fun events to attend while you're in Boston.

### Why This Matters

#### Know the Methods to Our Madness

There's a lot to learn, so there's a lot to teach! Giving you a little picture into our methods and philosophies will help you to understand why the course is structured the way it is.
