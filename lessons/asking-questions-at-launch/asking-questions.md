## What To Do When You Get Stuck

Welcome to Launch Academy's 5 Steps To Help&trade; program. This program will get you on your way to receiving the help that you deserve. Please remember to always follow the steps *in order*.

### Step 1. You can't know where you're going unless you first know where you are

Take a second to think about where you are. Are you trying to enter ruby commands without being in IRB? Are you trying to browse Google from the terminal. Make sure that you are in the right context.

### Step 2. Read what the computer is saying

Turns out that computers are much better at talking computer than we lousy humans are. Make sure you are reading the errors that are being shouted back at you. It's very easy to feel like you haven't done anything wrong and that it must be a bug with interpreter, but trust me. 99.999999999% of the time the errors are not lying to you. Read them carefully and see what information you can gain from them.

### Step 3. Google-fuuuu

Chances are that someone has suffered before you. Google and Stack Overflow are your friends. We are lucky enough to be part of a community invested in helping each other. Improve your Google-fu. It will serve you incredibly well on your journey to being a world class web developer. While Google and Stack Overflow are your friends, consider W3Schools your enemy! While it ranks well for HTML and CSS related queries, the material on there can tend to be misleading.

### Step 4. Two minds are better than one

Use your pair. Use your cohort. Use your rubber duck. So many problems can be solved just by talking it through with someone. As crazy as rubber-ducking may seem, it really works. And if that fails, use the minds of your talented cohort. Your fellow Launchers are a mountain of knowledge and you should be looking to tap into that knowledge.

### Step 5. File a Horizon Question

If all else fails, go ahead and file a Horizon Question to get assistance from an EE. You can do so by pressing the "Questions" button on the navbar in Horizon.

It's really important that you provide us with as much information as you can about your problem. The more information you provide us with, the better position we are going to be in to help you out. You should be aware that if your question does not demonstrate that you have given real thought to your issue, we may request a resubmission of the question.

Also, the more thoroughly you fill out a question, the more likely you are to realize what the problem is on your own, before even clicking "Submit". We see it all the time: the act of writing out the issue will magically bring you to a solution when you were stumped just a moment ago. That's great!

Here's the breakdown of what should be in a question, along with an example:

* The title should be a quick summary of what is going on.
* First, provide a context description. The context description should identify which assignment you're on (if you are working on an assignment) and provide more detail on what you are trying to do, as well as anything else that you feel maybe relevant.
* Next, include any resources that you have used so far in your attempt to find a solution.
* Last of all, describe the problem. This is where you can learn the most. Really try to think about what might be going wrong. This is also another opportunity for you to rubber duck and hopefully come to the solution by yourself. Include as much detail as you can, including the output/error messages you're running into (if applicable).

#### A note on questions

The Question Queue exist to keep you from spinning your wheels on a problem, so you should absolutely use it when you've been stuck for some time and have exhausted your other resources. But learning to troubleshoot for yourself is an extraordinarily valuable skill that you will rely on heavily as a developers, so don't shortchange yourself by an overreliance on EE support. Also, as we move to breakable toy and project work later in the course, question response times generally get longer as the issues involved become more complicated. Be prepared for that and work on developing your troubleshooting skills early so that you're able to solve more problems on your own later.

Finally, be considerate of your fellow Launchers when seeking help. EEs' time is a limited resource so submitting questions that are not fully thought through takes instruction time away from your peers.

And that is it. By following this 5 step program we can ensure that quality help is available for all.
